subsidiary of the operating partnership . we elected to treat gaea as a trs under the code for 2018 , and we elected to treat gaea as a reit under the code in 2019 and thereafter . also during 2018 ,

december 31 , 2020 we own approximately 23.0 % of gaea and is no longer consolidated in our financial statements . story_separator_special_tag we expect to use the net proceeds from the private placement to acquire mortgage loans and mortgage-related assets consistent with our investment strategy and that this additional capital will provide sufficient liquidity to both benefit from any investment opportunities and protect against future market disruption . notwithstanding this additional capital and liquidity , we expect continued volatility in the residential mortgage securities market in the short term and increased acquisition opportunities later in the year or early 2021. extended forbearance , foreclosure timelines and eviction timelines could result in lower yields and losses on our mortgage loan and beneficial interest portfolios and losses on our reo held-for-sale . ongoing disruption in the credit markets could result in margin calls from our financing counterparties and additional mark downs on our investments in debt securities , beneficial interests and mortgage loans . we believe that certain cyclical trends continue to drive a significant realignment within the mortgage sector notwithstanding the impact of the pandemic . through the end of the fourth quarter , the recent trends noted below have continued , including : historically low interest rates and elevated operating costs resulting from new regulatory requirements continue to drive sales of residential mortgage assets by banks and other mortgage lenders ; declining home ownership in certain areas due to rising prices , low inventory , tighter lending standards and increased down payment requirements that have increased the demand for single-family and multi-family residential rental properties ; rising home prices are increasing homeowner equity and reducing the incidence of strategic default ; rising prices have resulted in millions of homeowners being in the money to refinance ; the dodd-frank risk retention rules for asset backed securities have reduced the universe of participants in the securitization markets ; 48 the lack of a robust market for non-conforming mortgage loans will reduce the pool of buyers due to tighter credit standards as a result of the covid-19 pandemic ; and an increase in the prices of residential mortgage loans and residential real estate as a result of the covid-19 outbreak we believe will generate new opportunities in residential mortgage-related whole loan strategies . the origination of subprime and alternative residential mortgage loans remains substantially below 2008 levels and the qualified mortgage and ability-to-repay rule requirements have put pressure on new originations . additionally , many banks and other mortgage lenders have increased their credit standards and down payment requirements for originating new loans . recent market disruption from the pandemic has sharply reduced financing alternatives for borrowers not eligible for financing programs underwritten by the gses or the federal government . the combination of these factors has also resulted in a significant number of families that can not qualify to obtain new residential mortgage loans . we believe the u.s. federal regulations addressing “ qualified mortgages ” based on , among other factors such as employment status , debt-to-income level , impaired credit history or lack of savings , limit mortgage loan availability from traditional mortgage lenders . in addition , we believe that many homeowners displaced by foreclosure or who either can not afford to own or can not be approved for a mortgage will prefer to live in single-family rental properties with similar characteristics and amenities to owned homes as well as smaller multi-family residential properties . in certain demographic areas , new households are being formed at a rate that exceeds the new homes being added to the market , which we believe favors future demand for non-federally guaranteed mortgage financing for single-family and smaller multi-family rental properties . for all these reasons , we believe that demand for single-family and smaller multi-family rental properties will increase in the near term and remain at heightened levels for the foreseeable future . we believe that investments in residential rpls with positive equity provide an optimal investment value . as a result , we are currently focusing on acquiring pools of rpls , though we may acquire npls , either directly or with joint venture partners , if attractive opportunities exist . through our servicer , we work with our borrowers to improve their payment records . once there is a period of continued performance , we expect that borrowers will typically refinance these loans at or near the estimated value of the underlying property . we also believe there are significant attractive investment opportunities in the sbc loan and property markets and originate as well as purchase these loans , particularly in urban areas where there is a sustainable trend of young adults desiring to live near where they work . we focus on densely populated urban areas where we expect positive economic change based on certain demographic , economic and social statistical data . the primary lenders for smaller multi-family and mixed retail/residential properties are community banks and not regional and national banks and large institutional lenders . we believe the primary lenders and loan purchasers are less interested in these assets because they typically require significant commercial and residential mortgage credit and underwriting expertise , special servicing capability and active property management . it is also more difficult to create the large pools of these primary banks lenders and portfolio acquirers typically desire . we continually monitor opportunities to increase our holdings of these sbc loans and properties . we also believe that banks and other mortgage lenders have strengthened their capital bases and are more aggressively foreclosing on delinquent borrowers or selling these loans to dispose of their inventory . additionally , many npl buyers are now interested in reducing their investment duration and have begun selling rpls . factors that may affect our operating results acquisitions . our operating results depend heavily on sourcing residential rpls and sbc loans and , when attractive opportunities are identified , npls . we believe that there is generally a large supply of rpls available to us for acquisition and we believe the available supply provides for a steady acquisition pipeline of assets since large institutions are active sellers in the market .

"our selling , general and administrative expenses decreased $ 16.9 million , or 17 % , for fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013. of this amount , $ 9.9 million represents the cost incurred in 2013 associated with our erp implementation project which was ceased in august 2013. no such implementation costs were incurred for the comparative period in 2014. in addition , we reduced our headcount associated with the information technology structure that was originally built to support the erp project ; we streamlined our sales and marketing group ; and we implemented selective headcount reductions . costs associated with transaction fees totaled $ 0.5 million in 2014 compared to $ 1.0 million of such fees in 2013. although our stock-based compensation expense declined year-over-year , this decline was offset by an increase in compensation cost associated 25 with long-term incentive arrangements tied to the performance of our common stock . in addition , our incentive compensation costs increased in 2014 as a result of more favorable operating results year-over-year . depreciation and amortization . depreciation and amortization expense decreased $ 19.6 million , or 37 % , for fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013 , primarily associated with the cessation of our erp project in 2013. for the year ended october 31 , 2013 , we incurred incremental costs of $ 19.8 million of depreciation expense associated with the assets placed in service in conjunction with the erp implementation . when the project ceased in august 2013 , the remaining useful lives for the majority of the assets were accelerated to october 2013. therefore , a relatively small amount of depreciation expense was incurred in fiscal 2014 associated with the erp implementation effort . in addition , we incurred depreciation expense associated with assets placed into service during 2014 , including the greenville assets acquired in december 2013 , partially offset by the incremental depreciation and amortization associated with the alumco acquisition , which had a larger impact on 2013 since the assets acquired had a relatively short useful life . also affecting the results was the normal run-off of fixed assets and intangible assets which became fully depreciated during these periods . asset impairment charges . we recorded an impairment loss of $ 0.5 million in april 2014 associated with a facility in barbourville , kentucky . this facility was subsequently sold in may 2014 , resulting in an insignificant realized loss on the sale . interest expense . interest expense decreased slightly during fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013. during 2013 , we borrowed $ 23.5 million to fund the alumco acquisition and other working capital needs . this debt was retired within several months . no similar borrowings have occurred during 2014. other , net . other , net expense was not significant during fiscal 2014 or fiscal 2013 , and related primarily to net gains and losses on foreign currency exchange transactions and interest income . income taxes . we recorded income tax expense associated with continuing operations of $ 5.5 million during fiscal 2014 compared to a tax benefit of $ 6.9 million during fiscal 2013. the change in tax expense was driven by the change in pre-tax income which totaled $ 13.8 million for the year ended october 31 , 2014 compared to a pre-tax loss of $ 19.3 million for the year ended october 31 , 2013 , reflecting an effective tax rate of 39.6 % and 35.7 % for the respective years . additional items impacting the effective rate were the foreign tax rate differential , the effect of permanent book-to-tax differences , return to actual results and a discrete item totaling $ 1.1 million in 2014 associated with the incorporation of our u.k. branch as a subsidiary . in addition , we implemented certain tax strategies during 2014 which we believe will favorably reduce our effective rate in future periods , but had an unfavorable impact on the deferred tax rate for fiscal 2014. income ( loss ) from discontinued operations . we sold nichols on april 1 , 2014 and recorded a gain on the sale of $ 24.1 million , net of tax of $ 15.1 million . excluding this gain , the loss from discontinued operations would have been a loss of $ 5.1 million for the period from november 1 , 2013 ( start of the fiscal year ) through the date of sale , april 1 , 2014 , compared to income of $ 0.7 million for the year ended october 31 , 2013. the results for nichols prior to the sale in 2014 reflected the unfavorable impact of aluminum commodity prices , which contributed to lower throughput and lower volume , partially offset by the gain on involuntary conversion associated with the cold mill fire . the results for nichols in 2013 include a full-year of activity . 26 comparison of the fiscal years ended october 31 , 2013 and 2012 this table sets forth our consolidated results of operations for the twelve-month periods ended october 31 , 2013 and 2012. replace_table_token_7_th net sales . the increase in net sales for fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012 was primarily attributable to the following : ( 1 ) the acquisition of alumco on december 31 , 2012 , which contributed net sales of $ 49.1 million during the period in 2013 ; ( 2 ) an increase in demand for our insulating glass warm-edge spacers in europe , particularly in central europe , eastern europe and scandinavia , and to a lesser extent , in the united states ; ( 3 ) higher sales of vinyl window and doorprofiles , as favorable increases in demand resulted in a higher volume of units shipped , partially offset by the effect of pricing pressure and a decrease in pass-through surcharges for resin ; and ( 4 ) higher sales for our engineered components products , due largely to higher demand from a national customer . story_separator_special_tag in connection with our european operations , we expanded our plant in germany to a third production line which became operational in 2013. we expect demand for our warm-edge spacers to remain high in europe , but to be more challenged in north america , as sales of our higher-end spacer products continue to be negatively affected by the housing downturn in canada and the recent shift in new construction to multi-family dwellings in the united states . cost of sales . our cost of sales increased by $ 64.0 million , or 18 % , when comparing fiscal 2013 to fiscal 2012. this increase was slightly higher than the 16 % increase in net sales for the respective period . of this increase in cost of sales , $ 43.0 million was related to the alumco acquisition . in addition , we experienced pricing pressure , as well as higher material and labor costs . the profitability of our vinyl products continues to be challenged as we have provided volume discounts for our fastest growing customers and experienced an increase in the cost of resin , which is the primary raw material used to manufacture our vinyl profiles . as sales to certain customers increase , we are obligated to provide greater price concessions in the form of volume discounts , which ultimately reduce our profit margins . we were able to pass some of the higher resin costs on to our customers through price adjustments , but we did absorb a greater proportion of this expense during recent months , as reflected in the decline in overall profit margin year-over-year . as our business grows and throughput increases , we must retain quality workers by providing higher wages , more overtime pay and supplemental indirect labor . to offset these cost increases , we are focused on improving our operational and production efficiencies to lower overall manufacturing overhead costs , although we remain challenged in certain areas , including managing our scrap costs . an increase in material costs has adversely affected our current year gross margins . we completed a plan to consolidate our insulating glass spacer facilities in north america in august 2012. partially offsetting our increase in cost of sales was consolidation savings in fiscal 2013 totaling $ 4.7 million . selling , general and administrative . our selling , general and administrative costs decreased by $ 1.9 million , or 2 % , when comparing fiscal 2013 and fiscal 2012. during fiscal 2012 , we incurred $ 8.0 million of insulating glass consolidation related expenses that did not recur during fiscal 2013. in addition , we estimate annual pre-tax savings as a result of this consolidation of $ 4.0 million . these decreases in selling , general and administration expense were partially offset by the expense associated with alumco , which contributed $ 3.4 million during fiscal 2013. moreover , in 2010 , we adopted an implementation plan with regards to a new enterprise resource planning software . we began the implementation pursuant to this plan , and we incurred costs , of which a portion was expensed and a portion was capitalized as a fixed asset . in connection with this implementation , the amounts 27 expensed as selling , general and administrative expense during the years ended october 31 , 2013 and 2012 was $ 10.0 million and $ 5.5 million , respectively . the initial phase of the erp implementation was effective march 2013 , and we capitalized an asset totaling approximately $ 20.3 million . we continued to incur costs associated with this initial phase during the succeeding months after the asset was capitalized , all of which was expensed as incurred in accordance with u.s. gaap . in addition , we began incurring costs pursuant to the next phase of the erp implementation , a portion of which was expensed and a portion capitalized . concurrently , we incurred incremental costs related to additional personnel and consultants to support the implementation effort . we also recorded $ 0.7 million of incremental costs related to our self-insured worker 's compensation program ; higher costs associated with stock-based compensation expense on a year-over-year basis , partially offset by the benefit associated with other forfeited awards under our compensation plans for which the value is based on our common stock price ; higher employee training costs ; and transaction costs of $ 1.0 million incurred in early 2013 associated with the alumco acquisition . these increases were partially offset by lower incentive accruals based on earnings . depreciation and amortization . depreciation and amortization expense increased by $ 23.5 million , or 78 % , when comparing fiscal 2013 to fiscal 2012. of this amount , $ 2.8 million was related to certain intangible assets and fixed assets we acquired with the alumco purchase transaction . in addition , we invested approximately $ 17.7 million for capital improvements during the twelve months ended october 31 , 2013 , which resulted in additional depreciation expense compared to fiscal 2012. moreover , an increase of $ 20.3 million in fiscal 2013 in comparison to fiscal 2012 was primarily related to accelerated depreciation associated with our erp system . in august 2013 , our board of directors approved a plan to cease all activities associated with our erp implementation . effective october 31 , 2013 , we transitioned our manufacturing operations that were using the erp system to legacy systems . we expensed $ 1.2 million of construction in progress in august 2013. in addition , we incurred one-time termination benefits and minimal contract termination costs during the fourth quarter of 2013. we accelerated depreciation for the first phase
","overview our principal sources of funds are cash on hand , cash flow from operations , and borrowings under our $ 150 million senior unsecured revolving credit facility ( the credit facility ) . as of october 31 , 2014 we had $ 120.4 million of cash and equivalents , $ 140.7 million available under the credit facility and outstanding debt of $ 0.8 million , of which no amounts were outstanding under our credit facility . cash and cash equivalents increased by $ 70.7 million during fiscal 2014 due primarily to the sale of nichols which provided net proceeds of $ 107.4 million , partially offset by funds used for the greenville acquisition , capital investments in our manufacturing facilities , dividends paid , treasury shares purchased and on-going operational activities . analysis of cash flow 28 the following table summarizes our cash flow results for the years ended october 31 , 2014 , 2013 and 2012 : replace_table_token_8_th operating activities cash provided by operating activities decreased by $ 22.7 million for the year ended october 31 , 2014 compared to the year ended october 31 , 2013. a portion of this decrease is attributable to the nichols business which was sold on april 1 , 2014 , for which there were five months of activity in 2014 compared to a full-year for 2013. we combine the nichols discontinued operations with our continuing operations for cash flow presentation as permitted by u.s. gaap . the overall decline in operating cash flow also reflects an incremental investment in inventory , funding of pension commitments , payments related to long-term incentive arrangements for a retired officer , as well as timing associated with receivable collections and payables . these decreases in operating cash flow were partially offset by an increase in net income , driven by an increase in revenues which generated more cash receipts .

"until november 19 , 2019 , our corporate name was new media investment group inc. ( `` new media '' ) and gannett co. , inc. was a separate publicly traded company . on november 19 , 2019 , new media completed its acquisition of gannett co. , inc. ( which was renamed gannett media corp. and is referred to as `` legacy gannett '' ) . in connection with the acquisition , new media changed its name to gannett co. , inc. and assumed legacy gannett 's ticker symbol `` gci '' ( having previously traded under `` newm '' ) . as a result of the acquisition , historical results for 2019 represents legacy new media 's results up to and through the date of the acquisition plus the new consolidated company 's results of operations for the approximately six-week period between the date of acquisition and the 2019 fiscal year end . our current portfolio of media assets includes usa today , local media organizations in 46 states in the u.s. and guam , and newsquest , a wholly owned subsidiary operating in the united kingdom ( `` u.k.

relationships with hundreds of thousands of local and national businesses in both our u.s. and u.k. markets due to our large local and national sales forces and a robust advertising and digital marketing solutions product suite . the company reports in two operating segments , publishing and digital marketing solutions ( `` dms '' ) . we also have a corporate and other category that includes activities not directly attributable to a specific operating segment and includes broad corporate functions such as legal , human resources , accounting , analytics , finance , and marketing . a full description of our operating segments is included in note 14 — segment reporting of the notes to the consolidated financial statements . a discussion regarding our results of operations and changes in financial condition for 2019 as compared to 2018 is included in part ii , item 7 of our annual report on form 10-k for the fiscal year ended december 31 , 2019 ( the `` 2019 form 10-k '' ) , filed with the securities and exchange commission ( the `` sec '' ) on march 2 , 2020 , and is incorporated by reference herein . business trends we have considered several industry trends when assessing our business strategy : print advertising continues to decline as the audience increasingly moves to digital platforms . we look to optimize our print operations to efficiently manage for this declining print audience . we are focused on converting the growing digital audience into digital-only subscribers to our publications . small and medium-sized businesses ( `` smbs '' ) are facing an increasingly complex marketing environment and need to create digital presence to capture audience online . we offer a broad suite of dms products that offer a single , unified solution to meet their digital marketing needs . consumers are looking for experience-based , emotional connections and communities . usa today network ventures was designed to celebrate local communities and create opportunities for meaningful in-person and virtual experiences . when evaluating public company publishing peers for revenue trends , we include legacy gannett ( and legacy new media for the period when they were separate companies ) , lee enterprises , inc. , a. h. belo corporation , and tribune publishing company . we have tracked average revenue trends for this peer group for 2018 – 2020 across the print advertising , digital 36 advertising , and circulation categories , which is available through the third quarter of 2020. the covid-19 pandemic had a significant impact on revenue trends across the industry during 2020 , which we have described below : print advertising revenues were down 13 % -19 % annually prior to the pandemic , worsening to down 26 % -47 % during the second and third quarters of 2020 ; digital advertising revenues ( which often includes digital marketing services products ) performed between down 5 % to up 5 % annually prior to the pandemic . the majority of companies did not provide digital advertising breakouts during the second and third quarters of 2020 ; and circulation revenues were down 3 % -10 % annually prior to the pandemic , performing at the lower end of that range , down 9 % , during the second and third quarters of 2020. certain matters affecting comparability reclassifications certain amounts in prior period consolidated financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation . pursuant to our acquisition of legacy gannett , in the fourth quarter of 2019 we realigned the presentation of marketing services revenues generated by our upcurve subsidiary from other revenues to advertising and marketing services revenues on the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income ( loss ) . as a result of this updated presentation , advertising and marketing services revenues increased and other revenues decreased $ 58.2 million for the year ended december 30 , 2018. operating revenues , net income , retained earnings , and earnings per share remained unchanged . acquisitions in november 2019 , we acquired substantially all of the assets , properties , and business of legacy gannett for an aggregate purchase price of $ 1.315 billion . story_separator_special_tag given our extensive client base and volume of digital campaigns , we will also use data and insights to inform new and dynamic advertising products that we believe will deliver superior results . optimizing our traditional businesses across print and advertising we will continue to drive the profitability of our traditional print operations through economies of scale , process improvements , and optimizations . we are focused on optimizing our pricing and improving customer service for our print 38 t able of contents subscribers . print advertising continues to offer a compelling branding opportunity across our network due to our scale and unique reach at both the national and local community levels . prioritizing investments into growth businesses that have significant potential and support our vision by leveraging our unique footprint , trusted brands , and media reach , we identify , experiment , and invest in potential growth businesses . usa today network ventures is a strong example of one such experiment that has grown significantly since its founding in 2015. during 2020 , usa today network ventures was able to successfully pivot to hosting its events virtually , hosting over 250 events and maintaining 88 % of usa today network venture 's revenues compared to 2019 pro forma revenue performance . building on our inclusive and diverse culture to center around meaningful purpose , individual growth and customer focus inclusion , diversity and equity are core pillars of our organization and influence all that we do , from recruiting , development and retention , to day-to-day operations including hiring , onboarding , education , leadership training and professional development . we have published our inclusion goals for 2025 and our efforts underway to progress toward those goals and expect to publish our first workforce diversity report in the first quarter of 2021. we believe aligning our culture around empowering our communities to thrive and putting our customers at the center of everything we do will provide the foundation for our broader strategic efforts . impacts of covid-19 the ongoing covid-19 pandemic and related measures to contain its spread have resulted in significant volatility and economic uncertainty , which is expected to continue in the near term . while we have generally been exempt from mandates requiring closures of non-essential business and have been able to continue operations , these circumstances are expected to continue to create volatility and unfavorable trends in our financial results as individuals and businesses rationalize expenditures during this time of uncertainty . during the year ended december 31 , 2020 , the company experienced decreased demand for its advertising and digital marketing services , commercial print and distribution services , as well as reductions in events and the single copy and commercial distribution of its newspapers . the company currently expects that the covid-19 pandemic will continue to have a negative impact on the company 's business and results of operations in the near-term . longer term , the ultimate impact of the covid-19 pandemic on the company 's business and results of operations will depend on the severity and length of the pandemic , the duration and extent of the mitigation measures and governmental actions designed to combat the pandemic , as well as the changes in customer behavior as a result of the pandemic , all of which remain highly uncertain . as a result , the company has implemented , and continues to implement , measures to reduce costs and preserve cash flow . these measures include suspension of the quarterly dividend and refinancing of our debt , as well as reductions in discretionary spending . in addition , the company has deferred certain payroll tax remittance as permitted under the coronavirus aid , relief and economic security act ( `` cares act '' ) and negotiated the deferral of pension contributions , as well as continuing with its previously disclosed plan to monetize non-core assets . seasonality our revenues are subject to moderate seasonality , due primarily to fluctuations in advertising volumes . advertising and marketing services revenues for our publishing segment are typically highest in the company 's fourth quarter , due to holiday and seasonal advertising , and lowest in the first quarter , following the holiday season . the volume of advertising sales in any period is also impacted by other external factors such as competitors ' pricing , advertisers ' decisions to increase or decrease their advertising expenditures in response to anticipated consumer demand , and general economic conditions . recent developments senior secured convertible notes due 2027 on november 17 , 2020 , the company entered into an exchange agreement ( the ``

that may affect our results are discussed under part i , item 1a in this document under the heading “ risk factors. ” general our principal business consists of attracting deposits from the general public , as well as brokered deposits , and investing those funds primarily in loans secured by first mortgages on owner-occupied , one- to four-family residences , a variety of consumer loans , direct financing leases , commercial and industrial loans , and loans secured by commercial and multi-family real estate . we also obtain funds by utilizing fhlb advances . story_separator_special_tag when quoted prices are not available and are not provided by third party pricing services , management judgment is necessary to determine fair value . as such , fair value is determined using discounted cash flow analysis models , incorporating default rates , estimation of prepayment characteristics and implied volatilities . we evaluate all securities on a quarterly basis , and more frequently when economic conditions warrant additional evaluations , for determining if any other-than-temporary-impairments ( “ otti ” ) exist pursuant to guidelines established in asc 320. in evaluating the possible impairment of securities , consideration is given to the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than cost , the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer , and our ability and intent to retain our investment in the issuer for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in fair value . in analyzing an issuer 's financial condition , we may consider whether the securities are issued by the federal government or its agencies or government sponsored agencies , whether downgrades by bond rating agencies have occurred , and the results of reviews of the issuer 's financial condition . if management determines that an investment experienced an otti , we must then determine the amount of the otti to be recognized in earnings . if we do not intend to sell the security and it is more likely than not that we will not be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis less any current period loss , the otti will be separated into the amount representing the credit loss and the amount related to all other factors . the amount of otti related to the credit loss is determined based on the present value of cash flows expected to be collected and is recognized in earnings . the amount of the otti related to other factors will be recognized in other comprehensive income , net of applicable taxes . the previous amortized cost basis less the otti recognized in earnings will become the new amortized cost basis of the investment . if management intends to sell the security or more likely than not will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis less any current period credit loss , the otti will be recognized in earnings equal to the entire difference between the investment 's amortized cost basis and its fair value at the balance sheet date . any recoveries related to the value of these securities are recorded as an unrealized gain ( as accumulated other comprehensive income ( loss ) in stockholders ' equity ) and not recognized in income until the security is ultimately sold . from time to time we may dispose of an impaired security in response to asset/liability management decisions , future market movements , business plan changes , or if the net proceeds can be reinvested at a rate of return that is expected to recover the loss within a reasonable period of time . deferred tax asset . we have evaluated our deferred tax asset to determine if it is more likely than not that the asset will be utilized in the future . our most recent evaluation has determined that we will more likely than not be able to utilize our remaining deferred tax asset . income tax accounting . we file a consolidated federal income tax return . the provision for income taxes is based upon income in our consolidated financial statements , rather than amounts reported on our income tax return . deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases . deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled . the effect of a change in tax rates on our deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized as income or expense in the period that includes the enactment date . management strategy we are a community-oriented

story_separator_special_tag our annual impairment test for the goodwill is performed on october 1 on the following reporting units : 33 reporting unit impairment indicated dice no dice europe no energy yes finance no healthcare no hospitality no workdigital no the fair value of each reporting unit was in excess of the carrying value during the year ended december 31 , 2015 , with the exception of the energy reporting unit . goodwill impairment of $ 34.8 million was recorded during the year ended december 31 , 2015 at the energy reporting unit . the fair value of this reporting unit was determined by a combination of a discounted cash flow methodology and market comparable method . cash flow projections for this reporting unit decreased during the fourth quarter of 2015 due to a decline in financial performance resulting from declining oil prices . the charge is reflected as impairment of goodwill on the consolidated statements of operations . during the year ended december 31 , 2013 , an impairment loss of $ 6.3 million was recorded for the slashdot media reporting unit . the fair value of this reporting unit was determined by a discounted cash flow methodology . cash flow projections for this reporting unit decreased during the fourth quarter of 2013 due to a decline in financial performance and expectations for the business . during the year ended december 31 , 2013 , an impairment loss of $ 1.4 million was recorded for the health callings reporting unit . the fair value of this reporting unit was determined by a discounted cash flow methodology . during the fourth quarter of 2013 , the company determined that the health callings brand and website would be merged into the recently acquired health ecareers website . cash flow projections for health callings as a separate reporting unit were not sufficient to support the goodwill recorded . the losses are recorded as impairment of goodwill on the consolidated statements of operations . the determination of whether or not goodwill has become impaired involves a significant level of judgment in the assumptions underlying the approach used to determine the value of our reporting units . fair values are determined either by using a discounted cash flow methodology or by using a combination of a discounted cash flow methodology and a market comparable method . the discounted cash flow methodology is based on projections of the amounts and timing of future revenues and cash flows , assumed discount rates and other assumptions as deemed appropriate . we consider factors such as historical performance , anticipated market conditions , operating expense trends and capital expenditure requirements . additionally , the discounted cash flows analysis takes into consideration cash expenditures for product development , other technological updates and advancements to our websites and investments to improve our candidate databases . the market comparable method indicates the fair value of a business by comparing it to publicly traded companies in similar lines of business or to comparable transactions or assets . considerations for factors such as size , growth , profitability , risk and return on investment are analyzed and compared to the comparable businesses and adjustments are made . a market value of invested capital of the publicly traded companies is calculated and then applied to the entity 's operating results to arrive at an estimate of value . changes in our strategy and or market conditions could significantly impact these judgments and require adjustments to recorded amounts of goodwill . indefinite-lived acquired intangible assets the indefinite-lived acquired intangible assets include the dice trademarks and brand name . the dice.com trademark , trade name and domain name is one of the most recognized names of online job boards . since dice 's inception in 1991 , the brand has been recognized as a leader in recruiting and career development services for technology and engineering professionals . currently , the brand is synonymous with the most specialized online marketplace for industry-specific talent . the brand has a significant online and offline presence in online recruiting and career development services . considering the recognition and the awareness of the dice brand in the talent acquisition and staffing services market , dice 's long operating history and the intended use of the dice brand , the remaining useful life of the dice.com trademark , trade name and domain name was determined to be indefinite . we determine whether the carrying value of recorded indefinite-lived acquired intangible assets is impaired on an annual basis or more frequently if indicators of potential impairment exist . the impairment review process compares the fair value of the indefinite-lived acquired intangible assets to its carrying value . if the carrying value exceeds the fair value , an impairment loss is recorded . the impairment test performed as of october 1 resulted in no impairment . 34 the determination of whether or not indefinite-lived acquired intangible assets have become impaired involves a significant level of judgment in the assumptions underlying the approach used to determine the value of the indefinite-lived acquired intangible assets . fair values are determined using a profit allocation methodology which estimates the value of the trademark and brand name by capitalizing the profits saved because the company owns the asset . we consider factors such as historical performance , anticipated market conditions , operating expense trends and capital expenditure requirements . changes in our strategy and or market conditions could significantly impact these judgments and require adjustments to recorded amounts of intangible assets . income taxes we utilize the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes . under this method , deferred income taxes are recognized for differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities at enacted statutory tax rates in effect for the years in which the differences are expected to reverse . valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts expected to be realized .

"the primary component of our growth strategy is based upon our expectation of future divestitures by our sponsor to us of portions of its retained 75 % undivided interest in the pennsylvania mining complex . we have a right of first offer pursuant to our omnibus agreement to purchase the undivided interest in the pennsylvania mining complex retained by our sponsor . at december 31 , 2016 , our assets include a 25 % undivided interest in , and operational control over , consol energy 's pennsylvania mining complex , which consists of three underground mines and related infrastructure that produce high-btu bituminous thermal coal that is sold primarily to electric utilities in the eastern united states , our core market . we believe that our ability to efficiently produce and deliver large volumes of high-quality coal at competitive prices , the strategic location of our mines , the industry experience of our management team and our relationship with consol energy position us as a leading producer of high-btu thermal coal in the northern appalachian basin and the eastern united states . the pennsylvania mining complex , which includes the bailey mine , the enlow fork mine and the harvey mine , has extensive high-quality coal reserves . we mine our reserves from the pittsburgh no . 8 coal seam , which is a large contiguous formation of uniform , high-btu thermal coal that is ideal for high productivity , low-cost longwall operations . as of december 31 , 2016 , the partnership 's portion of the pennsylvania mining complex included 191.7 million tons of proven and probable coal reserves with an average gross heat content of approximately 12,970 btu per pound and approximately 3.7 pounds sulfur dioxide per million british thermal units ( `` lb so2/mmbtu '' ) . based on our current production capacity , these reserves are sufficient to support approximately 27 years of production . in addition , our reserves currently exhibit thermoplastic behavior suitable for cokemaking and contain an average of approximately 39 % -40 % volatile matter ( on a dry basis ) , which enables us , if market dynamics are favorable , to capture greater margins from selling our coal as a crossover product in the high-vol metallurgical market to cokemakers and steel manufacturers who utilize modern cokemaking technologies . on september 30 , 2016 , the partnership and its wholly owned subsidiary , cnx thermal holdings , entered into a contribution agreement ( the “ contribution agreement ” ) with consol energy , cpcc and conrhein and together with cpcc , ( the “ contributing parties ” ) , under which cnx thermal holdings acquired an undivided 6.25 % of the contributing parties ' right , title and interest in and to the pennsylvania mining complex ( which represents an aggregate 5 % undivided interest in and to the pennsylvania mining complex ) . the pa mining acquisition was a transaction between entities under common control ; therefore , the partnership recorded the assets and liabilities of the acquired 5 % of pennsylvania mining complex at their carrying amounts to consol energy on the date of the transaction . the difference between consol energy 's net carrying amount and the total consideration paid to consol energy was recorded as a capital transaction with consol energy , which resulted in a reduction in partners ' capital . the partnership recast its historical consolidated financial statements to retrospectively reflect the additional 5 % ( a total 25 % ) interest in pennsylvania mining complex as if the business was owned for all periods presented ; however , the consolidated financial statements are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations that would have occurred if the partnership had owned it during the periods reported . how we evaluate our operations our management team uses a variety of financial and operating metrics to analyze our performance . these metrics are significant factors in assessing our operating results and profitability . the metrics include : ( i ) coal production , sales volumes and average sales price ; ( ii ) cost of coal sold , a non-gaap financial measure ; ( iii ) average cash margin per ton , an operating ratio derived from non-gaap financial measures , ( iv ) adjusted ebitda , a non-gaap financial measure ; and ( v ) distributable cash flow , a non-gaap financial measure . cost of coal sold , average cash margin per ton , adjusted ebitda and distributable cash flow normalize the volatility contained within gaap measures , by adjusting certain non-operating or non-cash transactions . these metrics are used as supplemental financial measures by management and by external users of our financial statements , such as investors , industry analysts , lenders and ratings agencies , to assess : our operating performance as compared to the operating performance of other companies in the coal industry , without regard to financing methods , historical cost basis or capital structure ; the ability of our assets to generate sufficient cash flow to make distributions to our partners ; 49 our ability to incur and service debt and fund capital expenditures ; the viability of acquisitions and other capital expenditure projects and the returns on investment of various investment opportunities ; and the attractiveness of capital projects and acquisitions and the overall rates of return on alternative investment opportunities . the non-gaap financial measures should not be considered an alternative to total costs , net income , operating cash flow , or any other measure of financial performance or liquidity presented in accordance with gaap . these measures exclude some , but not all , items that affect net income or net cash , and these measures may vary from those of other companies . as a result , the items presented below may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies . reconciliation of non-gaap financial measures we evaluate our cost of coal sales on a cost per ton basis . story_separator_special_tag the 818 decrease in tons was attributable to reduced production to adjust to contracted sales commitments . the production at the harvey mine increased as a result of the commencement of longwall mining operations in march 2014. coal operations coal revenue and cost components on a per unit basis for the years ended december 31 , 2015 and december 31 , 2014 were as indicated in the table below . our operations also include various costs such as selling , general and administrative , freight and other costs not included in our unit cost analysis because these costs are not directly associated with coal production . replace_table_token_15_th ( 1 ) average cash margin per ton is an operating ratio derived from non-gaap measures . revenue and other income coal revenue was $ 322,261 for the year ended december 31 , 2015 compared to $ 404,247 for the year ended december 31 , 2014 . the $ 81,986 decrease was attributable to $ 5.52 per ton lower average sales price and an 814 decrease in tons sold . the lower average coal sales price per ton in the 2015 period was primarily the result of the overall decline in the domestic thermal and global coal markets . due to a weak domestic thermal spot market , 1,384 tons were sold on the export market for the year ended december 31 , 2015 as compared to 835 tons for the year ended december 31 , 2014 , which negatively impacted the average sales price per ton sold in the year-to-year comparison . freight revenue , which is completely offset in freight expense , is the amount billed to customers based on the weight of coal shipped and negotiated freight rates for rail transportation . freight revenue was $ 3,809 for the year ended december 31 , 2015 compared to $ 4,192 for the year ended december 31 , 2014 . the $ 383 decrease in freight revenue was due to decreased shipments to customers where we were contractually obligated to provide transportation services . other income is comprised of income generated by the partnership not in the ordinary course of business . other income was $ 941 for the year ended december 31 , 2015 compared to $ 9,660 for the year ended december 31 , 2014 . the $ 8,719 decrease was due to a $ 7,500 coal customer contract buyout in the 2014 period and $ 1,220 of various transactions in both periods , none of which were individually material . 57 cost of coal sold cost of coal sold is comprised of operating costs related to produced tons sold , along with changes in coal inventory , both in volumes and carrying values . the costs of coal sold per ton include items such as direct operating costs , royalties and production taxes , direct administration expenses , and depreciation , depletion , and amortization costs . total cost of coal sold was $ 238,899 for the year ended december 31 , 2015 , or $ 39,494 lower than the $ 278,393 for the year ended december 31 , 2014 . total costs per ton sold were $ 41.78 per ton for the year ended december 31 , 2015 compared to $ 42.61 per ton for the year ended december 31 , 2014 . the decrease in the cost of coal sold was driven by a reduced workforce , approximately 90,000 less feet of coal mined with continuous mining units , improved operational efficiencies , reduction of pennsylvania stream subsidence expense and other ongoing cost reduction efforts as a result of reducing production for 2015 to match the contracted sales commitments of the partnership . there was also a decrease in unit costs due to other post-retirement benefit ( `` opeb '' ) liabilities being retained by consol energy , in conjunction with the ipo . total other costs total other costs is comprised of various costs that are not allocated to each individual mine and therefore not included in unit costs . total other costs decreased $ 5,609 for the year ended december 31 , 2015 compared to the year ended december 31 , 2014 . the decrease was primarily attributable to the remeasurement of the opeb plans to reflect a plan amendment for salary and hourly workers that occurred on may 31 , 2015. opeb was excluded from the partnership at the time of the ipo . selling , general and administrative expense upon the closing of the ipo , the partnership entered into a service arrangement for consol energy to provide certain selling , general and administrative services . these services are paid monthly based on agreed upon rates . in addition , the partnership incurred various costs as a result of being a publicly traded entity for the year ended december 31 , 2015 . for the year ended december 31 , 2014 , consol energy allocated selling , general and administrative expenses based upon the level of operating activity of its underlying business units . these expenses include consol energy 's stock based compensation and short-term incentive compensation program , as well as costs that are directly related to our operations along with a portion of costs that are allocated to us based on a percent of total labor costs . the amount of selling , general and administrative expenses incurred was $ 10,931 for the year ended december 31 , 2015 compared to $ 17,149 for the year ended december 31 , 2014 . the $ 6,218 decrease was primarily attributable to lower short-term incentive compensation payouts . interest expense interest expense was $ 9,636 for the year ended december 31 , 2015 , which includes interest on the revolving credit facility that we entered into in connection with the completion of the ipo and interest expense incurred on the consol financial inc. ( `` cfi '' ) , a wholly owned subsidiary of consol energy , loan which was excluded from the partnership at the time of the ipo .

we focus on maximizing the value of our current production volumes , particularly taking advantage of favorable macro trends in our distillery products segment , such as the growth of the american whiskey category that has continued to expand over the past five years . this includes shifting sales mix to higher margin products , such as premium bourbon and rye whiskeys , as well as extending the product range of our grain neutral spirits , including vodkas and gins . in our ingredient solutions segment , the macro trend includes growth in high fiber , high protein , plant-based proteins , and non-genetically modified organisms ( `` non-gmo '' ) products . we intend to focus on the opportunities that will allow us to achieve the highest value from our current production facilities . accomplishments our shift in sales mix to higher margin products has led to increased net sales of food grade alcohol , which includes beverage alcohol , in 2015 of 10.5 percent over 2014. in the ingredient solutions segment , the shift in sales mix to higher margin products led to growth in net sales of specialty wheat starches of 6.3 percent over 2014. these sales mix shifts contributed to our gross margin expansion across both segments ( see the `` -- distillery products segment '' and `` -- ingredient solutions segment '' discussions ) . capture value share - we will work to develop partnerships to support brand creation and long-term growth , and to combine our innovation capabilities and industry expertise to provide unique solutions and offerings to the marketplace . in that way , we believe we will be able to realize full value for our operational capacity , quality and commitment . accomplishment we announced our first retail-distributed brand , metze 's select limited edition indiana straight bourbon whiskey which was made available for retail sale in september 2015. this product received an `` outstanding '' rating from a prominent industry publication , whiskey advocate . we feel this brand-launch showcases our range of expertise and strengthens our reputation with trade and consumer groups . invest for growth - we are committed to investing to support our growth . components of this growth strategy include : capital expenditures : capital expenditures focus largely on supporting innovation and product development , improving operational reliability , and strengthening our ability to support all aspects of growth in the whiskey category . select inventories : as demand grows for american whiskeys , in both the united states and global markets , we are building our inventories of aged premium whiskeys to fully participate in this growth . this initiative helps us build strong partnerships and open new relationships with potential customers , in addition to supporting the development of our own brands . story_separator_special_tag in 2015 , we partnered with various non-profit organizations in lawrenceburg and greendale , indiana , and in atchison , kansas , such as the united way , `` boxes of blessing , '' big brothers and big sisters , and the salvation army to support our communities . in november 2015 , we were honored as large business of the year by the dearborn county chamber of commerce in lawrenceburg , indiana , and in january 2016 , we were honored as the 2015 business of the year by the atchison area chamber of commerce in atchison , kansas . other 2015 activities other activities in 2015 that contributed to our overall growth and strategic implementation are described below : in september 2015 , we purchased 950,000 shares of our common stock , for $ 14,488 in a privately-negotiated transaction with f2 sea , inc. , an affiliate of seacor holdings , inc. pursuant to a stock repurchase agreement . seacor holdings , inc. is the 70 percent owner of icp , the company 's 30 percent equity method investment . on february 27 , 2015 , we entered into a five year , $ 80,000 revolving loan pursuant to a second amended and restated credit agreement with wells fargo bank , national association , as administrative agent . this capital , along with our operating cash flows , will provide us support for our growth initiatives ( see note 4 ) . 22 results of operations story_separator_special_tag style= '' font-family : inherit ; font-size:10pt ; font-style : italic ; '' > 2014 compared to 2013 operating income in 2014 increased to $ 16,619 from an operating loss of $ 5,199 in 2013 , primarily due to growth in our distillery products segment , the receipt of insurance recoveries during the year , a reduction in sg & a costs , partially offset by a slight decline in our ingredient solutions segment . in 2014 , gross profit in the distillery products segment increased by $ 8,023 and gross profit in the ingredient solutions segment decreased by $ 887 compared to 2013. gross profit in distillery products increased primarily due to the shift in alcohol product sales mix to premium spirits , a decrease in raw materials costs , partially offset by higher production costs . gross profit in ingredient solutions decreased primarily due to a lower average selling price and higher production costs , partially offset by a shift in ingredient solutions products sales mix to higher value specialty products and a decrease in raw materials costs . a fire in the atchison distillery in october 2014 shut down production of distillery products and ingredient solutions for seven days , resulting in higher production costs . during january 2014 , we experienced a fire at our lawrenceburg facility . the fire damaged certain equipment in the feed dryer house and caused a temporary loss of production in late january . we received $ 8,450 of insurance recovery proceeds during the year ended december 31 , 2014 related to the fire at our lawrenceburg facility , which , after the $ 160 property write-off , resulted in $ 8,290 of net insurance recoveries ( see note 17 ) . sg & a decreased by $ 6,101 year-versus-year . this decrease was primarily due to decreases of $ 4,894 and $ 1,207 related to the proxy contest and severance , and other costs , respectively . 25 basic and diluted earnings per share replace_table_token_6_th change in diluted earnings per share replace_table_token_7_th ( a ) changes are net of tax based on the effective tax rate for each base year . ( b ) percentage points ( `` pp '' ) . ( c ) 2013 versus 2014 is `` n/a '' due to a net loss per share in the base year . ( d ) weighted average shares outstanding change primarily due to the vesting of employee restricted stock units , the granting of common stock to directors , the purchase of vested stock by the company from employees to pay withholding taxes , and repurchases by the company of common stock . in september , 2015 , our board of directors authorized the purchase of 950,000 shares of our common stock in a privately negotiated transaction with f2 sea inc. , an affiliate of seacor holdings inc. pursuant to a stock repurchase agreement . on september 1 , 2015 , we completed this purchase . seacor holdings , inc. is the 70 percent owner of icp , the company 's 30 percent equity method investment ( see notes 6 and 8 ) . ( e ) earnings per share is computed by dividing net income ( loss ) from continuing operations attributable to common shareholders by the weighted average shares outstanding during each year . earnings allocated to participating securities , which includes nonvested restricted stock and rsus , are subtracted from net operating income ( loss ) , resulting in net operating income ( loss ) attributable to common shareholders ( see note 6 ) . 2015 compared to 2014 earnings per share increased to $ 1.48 in 2015 from $ 1.32 in 2014 , primarily due to performance from operations , partially offset by an increase in effective tax rate ( see note 5 ) , a decrease in insurance recoveries ( see note 17 ) , and lower equity method investment earnings year-versus-year ( see note 3 ) . 2014 compared to 2013 earnings per share increased to $ 1.32 in 2014 from a loss per share of $ 0.29 in 2013 , primarily due to performance from operations , higher equity method investment earnings year-versus year , and insurance recoveries received in 2014 compared to zero received in 2013 . 26 distillery products segment replace_table_token_8_th ( b ) percentage points ( `` pp '' ) 2015 compared to 2014 total distillery products net sales for 2015 increased $ 13,664 , or 5.3 percent driven by demand for the company 's premium beverage alcohol products . customer demand for premium spirits , including bourbon and rye whiskeys , was strong .
","consolidated results the table below details the year-versus-year consolidated results : replace_table_token_4_th ( a ) percentage points ( `` pp '' ) . 2015 compared to 2014 net sales - net sales for 2015 were $ 327,604 , an increase of 4.5 percent compared to 2014. this growth was primarily driven by a 5.3 percent increase in net sales in the distillery products segment . distillery products net sales increased primarily as a result of an increase in food grade alcohol , which includes beverage alcohol . net sales in the ingredient solutions segment as a whole increased 0.9 percent due to strong net sales of specialty wheat starches , partially offset by declines in other segment products . gross profit - gross profit for 2015 was $ 58,533 , an increase of 105.9 percent compared to 2014. the increase was primarily driven by an 8.8 percentage point increase in gross margin , as well as the net sales growth . gross margin expanded due to a higher average selling price despite lower raw material costs , favorable product sales mix , and improved plant efficiencies . operating income ( loss ) - operating income for 2015 was $ 32,850 , a 97.7 percent increase compared to 2014. operating margin expanded 4.7 percentage points . the increase was primarily driven by improved gross profit . gross profit growth was partially offset by lower insurance recoveries and higher sg & a ( see `` -- operating income '' table in the next section ) . equity method investment earnings ( loss ) - our equity method investment earnings decreased to $ 6,102 for 2015 , from $ 10,137 for 2014. the decrease in earnings was primarily due to lower icp sales volume and lower per unit average selling price compared to a year ago , partially offset by our $ 1,230 portion of icp 's receipt of $ 4,112 of insurance proceeds for business interruption during 2015 ( see note 3 ) .

company overview ” and “ business - regulatory environment ” sections of this annual report . our revenue is largely driven by the number of students enrolled at our institutions and the number of courses that they take . our consolidated revenue for the year ended december 31 , 2015 decreased to $ 327.9 million from $ 350.0 million in the year ended december 31 , 2014 . our consolidated revenue increased to $ 350.0 million in the year ended december 31 , 2014 from $ 329.5 million in the year ended december 31 , 2013 . the revenue decrease that occurred in 2015 was caused by a decrease in net course registrations at apus , while the revenue increase that occurred in 2014 was caused by the inclusion of hcon in our operating results for the entire year . 76 our operations are organized into two reportable segments : american public education segment , or apei segment . this segment reflects the operational activities at apus , other corporate activities , and minority investments . hondros college of nursing segment , or hcon segment . this segment reflects the operational activities of hcon . we acquired hcon on november 1 , 2013 , and therefore the consolidated results for periods prior to november 1 , 2013 do not include any results from hcon . financial information regarding each of our reportable segments is reported in this annual report in the sections “ financial statements and supplementary data , ” “ management 's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations - operating results by reportable segment year ended december 31 , 2015 compared to year ended december 31 , 2014 , ” and “ management 's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations - year ended december 31 , 2014 compared to year ended december 31 , 2013 . ” acquisition of hcon . we acquired hcon on november 1 , 2013 , and we continue to execute initiatives to grow hcon and improve its efficiency . these initiatives may result in increased operating expenses and capital investments , which may not result in higher revenue or net income . we received ed 's approval of our hcon change-in-ownership application on january 19 , 2016 , and hcon subsequently entered into a provisional program participation agreement , which requires hcon to comply with specific conditions while provisionally certified . further information regarding the hcon acquisition and the potential risks associated with it are further addressed in the “ business - regulatory environment ” and “ risk factors - risks related to our business ” sections of this annual report . changing student body . although apus 's focus has broadened , it continues to have an emphasis on its relationship with military and military affiliated communities . as of december 31 , 2015 , approximately 56 % of apus 's students self-reported that they served in the military on active duty at the time of initial enrollment , and as a result apus is particularly reliant on dod 's tuition assistance programs and dod 's budget . since 2006 , when apus began participating in ed 's title iv financial aid programs , or title iv programs , a significant portion of apus 's growth has been attributable to students using funds from those programs and , as a result , apus experienced a change in the composition of its student body , which has resulted , and may continue to result , in a need to provide a broader array of services to its students . story_separator_special_tag the july 2015 tuition increase was apus 's first undergraduate tuition increase since 2000 , and the first graduate tuition increase in four years . based on information in the college board 's 2015 trends in college pricing ( undergraduate ) and the national center for education statistics digest of educational statistics 2013-14 ( graduate ) , we estimate that , after the tuition increase , apus 's combined tuition , fees , and books remain approximately 19 % less for undergraduate students and 38 % less for graduate students than the average published in-state rates at public universities . in 2016 , we expect to evaluate repositioning select degree programs by implementing differentiated pricing , primarily to better align tuition of certain programs with higher market demand . we can not predict whether and when we would implement this change or how the implementation of tuition pricing by program would impact our net course registrations , results of operations , and financial condition . financial aid processing transition . in the third quarter of 2013 , apus transitioned from using the services of a third-party servicer to assist with the administration and management of apus 's participation in title iv programs to utilizing an internal solution that relied , in part , on software and services provided by a third-party vendor . we experienced unexpected delays in financial aid processing as a result of various software and programming errors and limitations , resulting in ed rejecting certain student records , an inability to disburse title iv program funds to some students , and other related issues . while we had anticipated that in connection with the transition there would be a delay in processing financial aid for a short period of time , the delays were longer than expected and there were more errors than expected . in addition , when the decision was made to move financial aid processing in-house using software supplied by a third-party vendor , we anticipated being able to automate certain manual processes . errors in the software , as well as lack of experience with the software by many of our financial aid staff , required manual work outside the system , increasing the time to process financial aid . apus attempted to work with the vendor to identify the causes of the delays , errors , and problems . many were resolved , but some remained , and apus had to perform manual work outside the automated system to process financial aid . challenges with the processing of 78 financial aid led to reputational problems , adverse effects on our operating results , reduced course enrollments , and increased costs . in april 2015 , apus began to transition its financial aid processing to a third-party servicer , global financial aid services . apus substantially completed the transition at the end of 2015. there were significant costs relating to the implementation of global financial aid services ' financial aid processing services and there may be significant costs and risks related to the transition going forward . for more information regarding the risks associated with apus 's financial aid processing systems and the transition back to global financial aid services , please see “ risk factors - risks related to our business. ” bad debt expense . over time we have experienced increases in our apei segment 's bad debt expense , though this trend has stabilized and bad debt expense decreased for the year ended december 31 , 2015 as compared to the prior year period . we have observed that some students enroll or attempt to enroll at apus solely to obtain funds from title iv programs , and some students who might not otherwise pursue a degree or certificate are attracted to enroll in apus 's programs because of the availability of such funds . we believe these students may be more likely than other students to cease pursuing a degree or certificate due to several factors , such as becoming employed , or not having the level of commitment necessary to successfully complete the required coursework . as described more fully above in “ risk factors - risks related to our business , ” we have also been the target of fraudulent activities by outside parties with respect to student enrollment and title iv programs , and should we experience growth we may be susceptible to an increased risk of such activities . we believe the factors discussed in this paragraph were the primary drivers of the increased bad debt expense that occurred during the years ended december 31 , 2013 and 2014 . we are not able to estimate the number of students who fall into these enrollment categories , and our ability to estimate the impact on our enrollments over time is limited , as is our ability to estimate any additional impact that this could have on our exposure to bad debt or the number of our students who default on their title iv program loans . we believe that our initiatives discussed in this annual report , including the new admissions process , have contributed to the stabilization of our apei segment 's bad debt expense . further , we believe that apus 's september 2015 change in the method by which it disburses title iv aid from a single disbursement method to a multiple disbursement method for first-time apus undergraduate students may result in further decreases in bad debt expense . impact of government budgetary pressures . on august 2 , 2011 , congress passed the budget control act of 2011 , which put into place a series of automatic federal budget cuts known as sequestration . the budget cuts , or sequestration , impact certain federal student aid programs , as well as department of defense , or dod , tuition assistance programs .
","results of operations we acquired hcon on november 1 , 2013 , and therefore our consolidated results for periods prior to november 1 , 2013 do not include any results from hcon , while periods after the date of hcon 's acquisition include hcon 's results . the following table sets forth statements of operations data as a percentage of revenue for each of the years ended : replace_table_token_9_th year ended december 31 , 2015 compared to year ended december 31 , 2014 revenue our consolidated revenue for the year ended december 31 , 2015 was $ 327.9 million , a decrease of $ 22.1 million or 6.3 % , compared to $ 350.0 million for the year ended december 31 , 2014 . the decrease in revenue was a result of a decrease in net course registrations in our apei segment . apei segment net course registrations , which include one-credit lab courses combined with their related three-credit course , decreased to approximately 375,100 in the year ended december 31 , 2015 from approximately 404,000 in the year ended december 31 , 2014 , a decrease of approximately 7.1 % . we believe that the decrease in the apei segment 's net course registrations for the year ended december 31 , 2015 , is attributable , in part , to increased competition , changes in our marketing approach , our new admissions assessment at apus , and our tuition increase at apus , among other factors as discussed in this annual report . costs and expenses costs and expenses were $ 275.6 million for the year ended december 31 , 2015 , a decrease of $ 8.6 million , or 3.0 % , compared to $ 284.2 million for the year ended december 31 , 2014 . this decrease was primarily the result of decreased sales and promotional and instructional costs and services expenses , partially offset by increased depreciation and amortization expenses .

"sales of held-for-sale loans during the fiscal year ended march 31 , 2013 totaled $ 25.6 million .tdr loans consist of loans where borrowers have been granted concessions in regards to the terms of their loans due to financial or other difficulties , which rendered them unable to repay their loans under the original contractual terms . total tdr loans at march 31 , 2013 were $ 21.7 million , $ 16.7 million of which were non-performing as they had not been performing in accordance with the restructured story_separator_special_tag the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the company 's consolidated financial statements and notes to consolidated financial statements presented elsewhere in this report . the company 's results of operations are significantly affected by general economic and competitive conditions , particularly changes in market interest rates , government policies , changes in accounting standards and actions of regulatory agencies . executive summary carver ended fiscal year 2013 with a return to profitability as it reported net income of $ 0.7 million compared to a net loss of $ 23.4 million in fiscal 2012 . the majority of the net income in the current fiscal year is due to negative provision for loan losses recorded in the second half of the year . the negative provision is primarily related to the decrease in non-performing loans , the stabilization in valuations of non-performing loans and a decrease in loss experience . at march 31 , 2013 , non-performing loans were $ 30.6 million , or 8.27 % of total loans as compared to $ 54.6 million , or 13.22 % of total loans at march 31 , 2012 . the business climate continues to present significant challenges and banks continue to compete for limited loan demand . nevertheless , carver federal seeks to generate new loan production and purchase loans at suitable prices such that the outstanding loan portfolio increases during the fiscal year . carver federal also intends to continue to focus on cost control . however , carver federal continues to be impacted by expenses related to managing the non-performing assets and higher fdic insurance and regulatory costs . critical accounting policies various elements of accounting policies , by their nature , are inherently subject to estimation techniques , valuation assumptions and other subjective assessments . carver 's policy with respect to the methodologies used to determine the allowance for loan and lease losses and assessment of the recoverability of the deferred tax asset are the most critical accounting policies . these policies are important to the presentation of carver 's financial condition and results of operations , and involve a higher degree of complexity and requires management to make difficult and subjective judgments , which often require assumptions or estimates about highly uncertain matters . such assumptions and estimates are susceptible to significant changes in today 's economic environment . the use of different judgments , assumptions and estimates could result in material differences in the company 's results of operations or financial condition . allowance for loan and lease losses the adequacy of the bank 's alll is determined , in accordance with the interagency policy statement on the allowance for loan and lease losses ( the “ interagency policy statement ” ) released by the office of the comptroller of the currency on december 13 , 2006 and in accordance with accounting standards codification ( “ asc ” ) topic 450 and asc topic 310. compliance with the interagency policy statement includes management 's review of the bank 's loan portfolio , including the identification and review of individual problem situations that may affect a borrower 's ability to repay . in addition , management reviews the overall portfolio quality through an analysis of delinquency and non-performing loan data , estimates of the value of underlying collateral , current charge-offs and other factors that may affect the portfolio , including a review of regulatory examinations , an assessment of current and expected economic conditions and changes in the size and composition of the loan portfolio are all taken into consideration . the alll reflects management 's evaluation of the loans presenting identified loss potential , as well as the risk inherent in various components of the portfolio . there is a great amount of judgment applied to developing the alll . as such , there can never be assurance that the alll accurately reflects the actual loss potential inherent in a loan portfolio . these assumptions and estimates are susceptible to significant change based on the current environment . further , any change in the size of the loan portfolio or any of its components could necessitate an increase in the alll even though there may not be a decline in credit quality or an increase in potential problem loans . 43 general reserve allowance carver 's maintenance of a general reserve allowance in accordance with asc topic 450 includes carver 's evaluating the risk to loss potential of homogeneous pools of loans based upon historical loss factors and a review of nine different environmental factors that are then applied to each pool . the pools of loans ( “ loan type ” ) are : 1-4 family construction multifamily commercial real estate business loans sba loans other ( consumer and overdraft accounts ) the pools are further segregated into the following risk rating classes : pass special mention substandard doubtful the bank next applies to each pool a risk factor that determines the level of general reserves for that specific pool . the risk factors are generally comprised of actual losses for the most recent four quarters as a percentage of each respective loan type plus nine qualitative factors . as the loss experience for a loan type increases or decreases , the level of reserves required for that particular loan type also increases or decreases . story_separator_special_tag the interest rate sensitivity gap is defined as the difference between the amount of interest-earning assets maturing or repricing within a specific period of time and the amount of interest-bearing liabilities maturing or repricing within that same time period . a gap is considered positive when the amount of interest rate sensitive assets exceeds the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities and is considered negative when the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities exceeds the amount of interest rate sensitive assets . generally , during a period of falling interest rates , a negative gap could result in an increase in net interest income , while a positive gap could adversely affect net interest income . conversely , during a period of rising interest rates a negative gap could adversely affect net interest income , while a positive gap could result in an increase in net interest income . as illustrated below , carver federal had a negative one-year gap equal to 30.7 % of total rate sensitive assets at march 31 , 2013 . as a result , carver federal 's net interest income may be negatively affected by rising interest rates and may be positively affected by falling interest rates . the following table sets forth information regarding the projected maturities , prepayments and repricing of the major rate-sensitive asset and liability categories of carver federal as of march 31 , 2013 . maturity repricing dates have been projected by applying estimated prepayment rates based on the current rate environment . the repricing and other assumptions are not necessarily representative of the bank 's actual results . classifications of items in the table below are different from those presented in other tables and the financial statements and accompanying notes included herein and do not reflect non-performing loans : 46 replace_table_token_10_th the table above assumes that fixed maturity deposits are not withdrawn prior to maturity and that transaction accounts will decay as disclosed in the table above . certain shortcomings are inherent in the method of analysis presented in the table above . although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods of repricing , they may react in different degrees to changes in the market interest rates . the interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance of changes in market interest rates , while rates on other types of assets and liabilities may lag behind changes in market interest rates . certain assets , such as adjustable-rate mortgages , generally have features that restrict changes in interest rates on a short-term basis and over the life of the asset . in the event of a change in interest rates , prepayments and early withdrawal levels would likely deviate significantly from those assumed in calculating the table . additionally , credit risk may increase as many borrowers may experience an inability to service their debt in the event of a rise in interest rate . virtually all of the adjustable-rate loans in carver federal 's portfolio contain conditions that restrict the periodic change in interest rate . economic value of equity ( “ eve ” ) analysis . as part of its efforts to maximize net interest income while managing risks associated with changing interest rates , management also uses the eve methodology . eve is the present value of expected net cash flows from existing assets less the present value of expected cash flows from existing liabilities plus the present value of net expected cash inflows from existing financial derivatives and off-balance-sheet contracts . under this methodology , interest rate risk exposure is assessed by reviewing the estimated changes in eve that would hypothetically occur if interest rates rapidly rise or fall along the yield curve . projected values of eve at both higher and lower interest rate risk scenarios are compared to base case values ( no change in rates ) to determine the sensitivity to changing interest rates . 47 presented below , as of march 31 , 2013 , is an analysis of the bank 's interest rate risk as measured by changes in eve for instantaneous parallel shifts of +/- 400 basis points change in market interest rates . such limits have been established with consideration of the impact of various rate changes and the bank 's current capital position . the information set forth below relates solely to the bank ; however , because virtually all of the company 's interest rate risk exposure lies at the bank level , management believes the table below also similarly reflects an analysis of the company 's interest rate risk : replace_table_token_11_th certain shortcomings are inherent in the methodology used in the above interest rate risk measurements . modeling changes in eve require the making of certain assumptions , which may or may not reflect the manner in which actual yields and costs respond to changes in market interest rates . in this regard , the models presented assume that the composition of our interest sensitive assets and liabilities existing at the beginning of a period remains constant over the period being measured and also assumes that a particular change in interest rates is reflected uniformly across the yield curve regardless of the duration to maturity or repricing of specific assets and liabilities . accordingly , although the eve table provides an indication of carver federal 's interest rate risk exposure at a particular point in time , such measurements are not intended to and do not provide a precise forecast of the effect of changes in market interest rates on carver federal 's net interest income and may differ from actual results . average balance , interest and average yields and rates the following table sets forth certain information relating to carver federal 's average interest-earning assets and average interest-bearing liabilities and related yields for the years ended march 31 , 2013 , 2012 , and 2011 .

"on december 19 , 2016 , we entered into an at market issuance sales agreement with fbr capital markets & co. , or fbr , pursuant to which we were able to issue and sell shares of our common stock having an aggregate offering price up to $ 30.0 million , through fbr as our sales agent . in conjunction with the sales agreement , fbr received compensation based on an aggregate of 3 % of the gross proceeds on the sale price per share of our common stock . any sales made pursuant to the sales agreement were deemed an “ at-the-market ” offering and were made pursuant to story_separator_special_tag you should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes and other financial information included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k. some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis , including information with respect to our plans and strategy for our business , includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties . you should review the “ risk factors ” section of this annual report for a discussion of important factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis or elsewhere in this annual report . overview we are a pre-commercialization biopharmaceutical company focused on saving and improving the lives of pets . our mission is to bring to our pets the same kinds of safe and effective medicines that our human family members enjoy . our core strategy is to identify compounds and targets that have already demonstrated safety and efficacy in humans and to develop therapeutics based on these validated compounds and targets for pets , primarily dogs , cats and horses . we believe this approach will lead to shorter development times and higher approval rates than pursuing new , non-validated compounds and targets . our current portfolio includes over 20 product candidates in development consisting of both small molecule pharmaceuticals and biologics . we have submitted all major technical sections of the new animal drug application , or nada , to the food and drug administration , or fda , for two product candidates . in addition , we have multiple other product candidates , including several biologics , in various stages of development . we believe there are significant unmet medical needs for pets , and that the pet therapeutics segment of the animal health industry is likely to grow substantially as new therapeutics are identified , developed and marketed specifically for pets . we announced positive topline results in may 2016 upon the successful completion of a pharmacokinetic study and a randomized , placebo-controlled pivotal study of mirataz ( mirtazapine transdermal ointment ) , formerly known as kind-010 , for the management of weight loss in cats . all major technical sections of the nada have been filed . we have received the technical section complete letter for effectiveness from the fda and responded to the one remaining comment from the fda regarding the cmc technical section . the fda did not have any further comments on the safety technical section . based on the feedback , we anticipate the approval of mirataz and are preparing for the commercial launch in the first half of 2018 , assuming that the fda finds our responses acceptable . the regulatory approval is expected , but is subject to the typical risks inherent in such a process . the european marketing agency , or ema , has accepted our european marketing authorization application for the review of mirataz with the official acceptance date of december 21 , 2017. in november 2015 , we completed a pivotal trial of zimeta ( dipyrone injection ) , previously known as kind-012 , for the control of pyrexia ( fever ) in horses with positive topline results . we submitted all major technical sections of the nada for zimeta to the fda before the end of the first quarter of 2016. we have received the technical section complete letters for effectiveness and safety from the fda and responded to additional comments from the fda regarding the cmc technical section . we anticipate the approval of zimeta in the first half of 2018 , assuming that the fda finds our responses acceptable . the regulatory approval is expected , but is subject to the typical risks inherent in such a process . 47 we have initiated pre-launch activities for mirataz and zimeta , including build-out of a small commercial team , execution of distribution agreements and commercial scale-up and manufacturing . in addition , we executed a commercial manufacturing agreement with dpt laboratories , ltd. for the manufacture of mirataz and a commercial manufacturing agreement with corden pharma spa for the manufacture of zimeta . the two agreements provide for production to supply kindredbio 's initial launch and future commercial campaigns upon regulatory approval , with capabilities to meet excess demand . we have also completed the pivotal field effectiveness study of zimeta oral ( dipyrone oral gel ) for the treatment of fever in horses and announced positive topline results in december 2017. this study was a multicenter , randomized , blinded , placebo-controlled pivotal study that enrolled 139 horses to assess the effectiveness of zimeta oral . we have completed the in-life portion of the target animal safety study and are analyzing the data . we anticipate submitting the effectiveness and safety technical sections of the nada in the first half of 2018 , and the cmc technical section by the end of 2018 , assuming the data are supportive of approval . the oral gel form of dipyrone is expected to be an additional valuable tool for equine veterinarians to provide horse owners with an easy-to-administer fever reducing agent for the horse . story_separator_special_tag we track outsourced development costs by development compound but do not allocate personnel or other internal costs related to development to specific programs or development compounds as these expenses are included in personnel costs and other internal costs . general and administrative expense general and administrative expense consists primarily of personnel costs , including salaries , related benefits and stock-based compensation for employees , consultants and directors . general and administrative expenses also include rent and other facilities costs , professional fees for legal , accounting , tax , information technology services , costs associated with being a public company and other general business services . interest and other income , net consist of interest earned on our cash , cash equivalents and short-term investments and asset disposals . 49 income taxes as of december 31 , 2017 , we had net operating loss carryforwards for federal and state income tax purposes of $ 93,253,000 and $ 93,172,000 , respectively , which will begin to expire in fiscal year 2032 . our management has evaluated the factors bearing upon the realizability of our deferred tax assets , which are comprised principally of net operating loss carryforwards . our management concluded that , due to the uncertainty of realizing any tax benefits as of december 31 , 2017 , a valuation allowance was necessary to fully offset our deferred tax assets . critical accounting policies and significant judgments and estimates our management 's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements , which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states , or u.s. gaap . the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities , and revenue , costs and expenses and related disclosures during the reporting periods . on an ongoing basis , we evaluate our estimates and judgments , including those described below . we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances , the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources . actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions . while our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note 2 of the notes to our consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this document , we believe that the estimates and assumptions involved in the following accounting policies may have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements . jobs act on april 5 , 2012 , the jumpstart our business startups act , or the jobs act , was signed into law . the jobs act contains provisions that , among other things , reduce certain reporting requirements for an “ emerging growth company. ” as an “ emerging growth company ” we are electing not to take advantage of the extended transition period afforded by the jobs act for the implementation of new or revised accounting standards , and as a result , we will comply with new or revised accounting standards on the relevant dates on which adoption of such standards is required for non-emerging growth companies . section 107 of the jobs act provides that our decision not to take advantage of the extended transition period is irrevocable . we are currently relying on other exemptions and reduced reporting requirements provided by the jobs act which state , among other things , that we are not required to ( i ) provide an auditor 's attestation report on our system of internal control over financial reporting or ( ii ) comply with any requirement that may be adopted by the public company accounting oversight board regarding mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor 's report providing additional information about the audit and the consolidated financial statements . these exemptions will apply for a period of five years following the completion of our initial public offering or until we no longer meet the requirements of being an “ emerging growth company , ” whichever is earlier . fair value measurements we invest our cash in money market funds , cash deposits and debt instruments of the u.s. government agency securities . in the current market environment , the assessment of the fair value of the debt securities can be difficult and subjective . accounting standards codification , or asc , 820 , “ fair value measurements and disclosure '' standard describes a fair value hierarchy based on three levels of inputs , of which the first two are considered observable and the last unobservable , that may be used to measure fair value which are the following : 50 level 1 quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities ; level 2 inputs other than level 1 that are observable , either directly or indirectly , such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities ; quoted prices in markets that are not active ; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities ; and level 3 unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities . the determination of fair value for level 3 instruments requires the most management judgment and subjectivity . research and development as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements , we are required to estimate accrued research and development expenses . examples of estimated accrued expenses include fees paid to vendors and clinical sites in connection with our pivotal studies , to cros in connection with our toxicology studies , and to contract manufacturers in connection with the production of api and formulated drug .
","results of operations the following table summarizes the results of our operations for the periods indicated : replace_table_token_4_th revenue we do not have any products approved for sale , have not generated any revenue since our inception and do not expect to generate any material revenue in the near future . if our development efforts result in clinical success and regulatory approval or collaboration agreements with third parties for any of our product candidates , we may generate revenue from those product candidates . research and development expense all costs of research and development are expensed in the period incurred . research and development costs consist primarily of salaries and related expenses for personnel , stock-based compensation expense , fees paid to consultants , outside service providers , professional services , travel costs and materials used in clinical trials and research and development . we are currently pursuing multiple product candidates for over 20 indications . we typically use our employee and infrastructure resources across multiple development programs . research and development expense was as follows for the periods indicated : 52 replace_table_token_5_th during the year ended december 31 , 2017 , research and development expense related primarily to advancing the development of zimeta oral and our leading small molecule and biologics product candidates . during this period we successfully completed and announced positive topline results on the pivotal trial of zimeta oral . we have responded to all comments from the fda related to the nada for zimeta as well as mirataz . we continue to advance additional product candidates in our small molecule programs as well as continue to advance our biologics program by building an in-house team to finalize the set-up of a gmp manufacturing process for our potential biologic candidates .

broad-line supply solutions to the convenience retail industry . consistent with this mission , our strategic framework is centered around three key initiatives : growing sales and margins faster than the industry , providing industry-leading category management solutions and leveraging our cost structure . the convenience wholesale and retail industry remains highly fragmented , supporting significant opportunities for both organic growth and growth through strategic acquisitions . core-mark is one of the largest wholesale distributors to the convenience retail industry in north america , one of two national convenience distributors in the u.s. and the largest in canada , and represents an estimated 7 % market share of the in-store sales of convenience stores in north america . our

while serving traditional convenience retailers remains the primary driver for our business , we serve a wide variety of alternative convenience retail formats including mass merchandisers , casinos , colleges and airports . driving growth through these alternative convenience retail formats and channels is a core component of our strategy and we see significant opportunities to drive growth organically , through acquisitions and strategic partnerships . our focus on providing industry-leading category management solutions to our customers positions us to partner with retailers to help increase their sales and profits . we offer a wide array of marketing programs , innovative product alternatives , data aggregation and loyalty solutions to our customers in pursuit of category

centralizing transactional processes and employee engagement aimed at increasing productivity . we believe consistent execution on the aforementioned strategic priorities will position core-mark as the leader in convenience retail distribution and provides a strong pathway to achieve sustainable shareholder returns . other business developments the effects of the covid-19 pandemic had an impact on our operating results during the year ended december 31 , 2020 , and we expect the pandemic will continue to affect our business for some period of time . while the vast majority of our customers are convenience retailers that continue to operate as essential businesses , the unprecedented impact of the covid-19 pandemic since the second quarter of 2020 , including shelter-in-place orders by states , provinces , cities and counties resulted in a significant downturn in miles driven , resulting in a decline in convenience retail store visits across north america . although we are seeing recovery as consumer purchase trends improve , we expect future results to continue to be impacted by the effects of the covid-19 pandemic . dividends the board of directors approved the following

reconciliation of food/non-food remaining gross profit margin in “ non-gaap financial information ” ) , decreased to 11.80 % in 2020 from 12.26 % in 2019 , driven primarily by a decrease in sales in certain higher margin categories including food and hb & g , an increase in sales in our lower margin otp category , and a decline in margin rate , primarily in alternative nicotine products within the hb & g category . in 2020 , our remaining gross profit for food/non-food products was 75.1 % of our total remaining gross profit compared to 76.8 % for 2019. operating expenses . our operating

"despite the industry challenges of a slow growth economy , increased competition , continued pressure on the net interest margin and increased regulatory and compliance requirements , management believes that it is imperative that the company continue to make strategic investments in its future . management will strive to grow the balance sheet and manage expenses in 2012 in order to achieve expected results . management anticipates that the continuation of solid fundamentals and asset quality will drive the company 's results in 2012. management has provided diluted earnings per share estimates of $ 2.05 to $ 2.15 in 2012 as compared to the diluted earnings per share of $ 2.12 for 2011 . 36 non-gaap measures when management assesses the company 's financial performance for purposes of making day-to-day and strategic decisions , it does so based upon the performance of its core banking business , which is primarily derived from the combination of net interest income and noninterest or fee income , reduced by operating expenses , the provision for loan losses , and the impact of income taxes . the company 's financial performance is determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ( gaap ) which sometimes includes gains or losses due to items that management does not believe are related to its core banking business , such as gains or losses on the sales of securities , merger and acquisition expenses , and other items . management , therefore , also computes the company 's non-gaap operating earnings , which excludes these items , to measure the strength of the company 's core banking business and to identify trends that may to some extent be obscured by gains or losses which management deems not to be core to the company 's operations . management believes that the financial impact of the items excluded when computing non-gaap operating earnings will disappear or become immaterial within a near-term finite period . management 's computation of the company 's non-gaap operating earnings information is set forth because management believes it may be useful for investors to have access to the same analytical tool used by management to evaluate the company 's core operational performance so that investors may assess the company 's overall financial health and identify business and performance trends that may be more difficult to identify and evaluate when noncore items are included . management also believes that the computation of non-gaap operating earnings may facilitate the comparison of the company to other companies in the financial services industry . non-gaap operating earnings should not be considered a substitute for gaap operating results . an item which management deems to be noncore and excludes when computing non-gaap operating earnings can be of substantial importance to the company 's results for any particular quarter or year . the company 's non-gaap operating earning information set forth is not necessarily comparable to non-gaap information which may be presented by other companies . the following table summarizes the impact of noncore items recorded for the time periods indicated below and reconciles them in accordance with gaap : replace_table_token_11_th 37 the following non-gaap financial measure is used by the company to provide information that management believes is useful to investors in understanding the company 's operating performance . the company 's tangible common equity ratio is 6.80 % , or 7.18 % when presented as adjusted to include the tax deductibility of certain goodwill . the following table reconciles the calculation of this non-gaap measure : replace_table_token_12_th financial position securities portfolio the company 's securities portfolio consists of trading securities , securities available for sale , and securities which management intends to hold until maturity . securities decreased by $ 69.3 million , or 11.8 % , at december 31 , 2011 as compared to december 31 , 2010. the ratio of securities to total assets as of december 31 , 2011 was 10.4 % , compared to 12.5 % at december 31 , 2010. the company continually reviews investment securities for the presence of other-than-temporary impairment ( otti ) . further analysis of the company 's otti can be found in note 3 securities within notes to consolidated financial statements included in item 8 hereof . the company 's trading securities were $ 8.2 million and $ 7.6 million at december 31 , 2011 and 2010 , respectively , and are comprised of securities which are held solely for the purpose of funding certain executive nonqualified retirement obligations and a community development mutual fund investment . 38 the following table sets forth the fair value of available for sale securities and the amortized cost of held to maturity securities along with the percentage distribution : table 1  fair value of securities available for sale and amortized cost of securities held to maturity replace_table_token_13_th the company 's available for sale securities are carried at fair value and are categorized within the fair value hierarchy based on the observability of model inputs . securities which require inputs that are both significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable are classified as level 3. as of december 31 , 2011 and 2010 , the company had $ 13.1 million and $ 17.3 million of securities categorized as level 3 , which represented 3.7 % and 4.1 % of the total assets recorded at fair value , respectively . 39 the following tables set forth contractual maturities of the bank 's securities portfolio at december 31 , 2011. actual maturities will differ from contractual maturities because borrowers may have the right to call or prepay obligations with or without call or prepayment penalties . table 2  fair value of securities available for sale and amortized cost of securities held to maturity , amounts maturing replace_table_token_14_th as of december 31 , 2011 , the weighted average life of the securities portfolio was 4.3 years and the modified duration was 3.5 years . story_separator_special_tag delinquency the bank 's philosophy toward managing its loan portfolios is predicated upon careful monitoring , which stresses early detection and response to delinquent and default situations . the bank considers a loan to have defaulted when it reaches 90 days past due . the bank seeks to make arrangements to resolve any delinquent or default situation over the shortest possible time frame . generally , the bank requires that a 42 delinquency notice be mailed to a borrower upon expiration of a grace period ( typically no longer than 15 days beyond the due date ) . reminder notices may be sent and telephone calls may be made prior to the expiration of the grace period . if the delinquent status is not resolved within a reasonable time frame following the mailing of a delinquency notice , the bank 's personnel charged with managing its loan portfolios , contact the borrower to ascertain the reasons for delinquency and the prospects for payment . any subsequent actions taken to resolve the delinquency will depend upon the nature of the loan and the length of time that the loan has been delinquent . the borrower 's needs are considered as much as reasonably possible without jeopardizing the bank 's position . a late charge is usually assessed on loans upon expiration of the grace period . nonaccrual loans as a general rule , within commercial real estate or home equity categories , loans more than 90 days past due with respect to principal or interest are classified as nonaccrual loans . as permitted by banking regulations , certain consumer loans past due 90 days or more continue to accrue interest . in addition , certain commercial and real estate loans that are more than 90 days past due may be kept on an accruing status if the loans are well secured and in the process of collection . income accruals are suspended on all nonaccrual loans and all previously accrued and uncollected interest is reversed against current income . a loan remains on nonaccrual status until it becomes current with respect to principal and interest ( and in certain instances remains current for up to six months ) , when the loan is liquidated , or when the loan is determined to be uncollectible and is charged-off against the allowance for loan losses . troubled debt restructurings in the course of resolving problem loans , the bank may choose to restructure the contractual terms of certain loans . the bank attempts to work-out an alternative payment schedule with the borrower in order to avoid or cure a default . any loans that are modified are reviewed by the bank to identify if a tdr has occurred , which is when , for economic or legal reasons related to a borrower 's financial difficulties , the bank grants a concession to the borrower that it would not otherwise consider . terms may be modified to fit the ability of the borrower to repay in line with its current financial status and the restructuring of the loan may include the transfer of assets from the borrower to satisfy the debt , a modification of loan terms , or a combination of the two . if such efforts by the bank do not result in satisfactory performance , the loan is referred to legal counsel , at which time foreclosure proceedings are initiated . at any time prior to a sale of the property at foreclosure , the bank may terminate foreclosure proceedings if the borrower is able to work-out a satisfactory payment plan . it is the bank 's policy to have any restructured loans which are on nonaccrual status prior to being modified remain on nonaccrual status for six months , subsequent to being modified , before management considers its return to accrual status . if the restructured loan is on accrual status prior to being modified , it is reviewed to determine if the modified loan should remain on accrual status . loans that are considered tdrs are classified as performing , unless they are on nonaccrual status or greater than 90 days delinquent . all tdrs are considered impaired by the company , unless it is determined that the borrower is performing under modified terms and the restructuring agreement specified an interest rate greater than or equal to an acceptable rate for a comparable new loan at the time of the restructuring . nonperforming assets nonperforming assets are comprised of nonperforming loans , nonperforming securities , other real estate owned ( oreo ) , and other assets in possession . nonperforming loans consist of nonaccrual loans and loans that are more than 90 days past due but still accruing interest . nonperforming securities consist of securities that are on nonaccrual status . the company holds six collateralized debt obligation securities ( cdos ) comprised of pools of trust preferred securities issued by banks and insurance companies , which are currently deferring interest payments on certain tranches within the bonds ' structures including the tranches held by the company . the bonds are anticipated to continue to defer interest until cash flows are sufficient to satisfy certain collateralization levels designed to protect more senior tranches . as a result the company has placed the six securities on nonaccrual status and has reversed any previously accrued income related to these securities . 43 oreo consists of properties which when deemed to be controlled by the bank , are recorded at fair value less cost to sell at the date control is established , resulting in a new cost basis . the amount by which the recorded investment in the loan exceeds the fair value ( net of estimated cost to sell ) of the foreclosed asset is charged to the allowance for loan losses . subsequent declines in the fair value of the foreclosed asset below the new cost basis are recorded through the use of a valuation allowance . subsequent increases

mobile environments . we offer our customers several pricing options including cost-per-thousand-impression , commonly referred to as cpm , whereby our customers pay based on the number of times the target audience is exposed to the advertisement , and on a monthly service fee . 17 during 2017 , we launched a new srax social tool for digital marketers and content owners to create posts and promote them beyond their respective facebook page communities . this tool is the first of many planned monetization opportunities to be developed and integrated into srax social . we also released a new guide entitled people-based advertising : how to get bigger results by targeting the most precise audience which we believe will provide support for our expertise as an internet advertising resource . we also unveiled the company 's new srax branding , designed to reflect the breadth and depth of the tools that we offer to digital marketers and content owners . in the third quarter of 2017 , we announced several new product offerings designed to expand our reach for advertisers to other large digital audiences . srax fan is a buyside vertical focused on advertising to sports fans on their mobile devices in stadiums and sports bars . srax auto is another new buyside vertical launched to target car buyers . while srax fan and srax auto have formally launched , they remain very early stage . as such , we do not believe these two new initiatives will be significant contributors to revenue growth for the remainder of 2018. during the third quarter of 2017 , we also announced the launch of the bigtoken project . presently we are developing bigtoken as a wholly owned subsidiary of social reality and eventually anticipate spinning the company out to our shareholders . in march of 2018 , we announced the alpha launch of the big platform to a select group of individuals and entities . users participating in our bigtoken alpha will be able to create an account , integrate third party accounts and answer serves in order to create an initial data graph . participants in the alpha will be awarded points as opposed to a bigtoken . although the alpha launch was a

story_separator_special_tag includes cash and cash equivalents of $ 1.1 million and $ 1 million as of december 31 , 2017 and 2016 , respectively . our working capital increased by $ 9,400,122 in 2017. our current assets decreased by $ 3,663,934 primarily from decreases in accounts receivable generated from lower gross revenue from advertisers . our current liabilities decreased by $ 13,064,059 primarily from decreases in accounts payable as a result of payments made to outstanding vendors utilizing proceeds from issuance of convertible debentures and warrant exercise proceeds . liquidity is the ability of a company to generate sufficient cash to satisfy its needs for cash . our primary need for liquidity is to fund working capital requirements of our business and other general corporate purposes , including debt repayment . story_separator_special_tag sufficiency of cash balances and potential sources of additional capital our capital requirements depend on many factors , including , among others : the acceptance of , and demand for , our products and services ; our levels of net product revenues and any other revenues we may receive ; the extent and timing of any investments in developing , marketing and launching new or enhanced products or technologies ; the costs of developing , improving and maintaining our internal design , testing and development processes ; the costs associated with maintaining , defending and enforcing our intellectual property rights ; and the nature and timing of acquisitions and other strategic transactions or relationships in which we engage , if any . 22 we believe our existing cash balance , together with cash provided by our operations and taking into account cash expected to be used in our operations , will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for at least the next 12 months . however , our estimates of our operating revenues and expenses and working capital requirements could be incorrect and we may use our cash resources faster than we anticipate . further , some or all of our ongoing or planned investments may not be successful and could further deplete our capital without immediate , or any , cash returns . until we can generate sufficient revenues to finance our cash requirements from our operations , which we may never do , we may need to increase our liquidity and capital resources by one or more measures , which may include , among others , reducing operating expenses , restructuring our balance sheet by negotiating with creditors and vendors , entering into strategic partnerships or alliances , raising additional financing through the issuance of debt , equity or convertible securities or pursuing alternative sources of capital , such as through asset or technology sales or licenses or other alternative financing arrangements . further , even if our near-term liquidity expectations prove correct , we may still seek to raise capital through one or more of these financing alternatives . however , we may not be able to obtain capital when needed or desired , on terms acceptable to us or at all . inadequate working capital would have a material adverse effect on our business and operations and could cause us to fail to execute our business plan , fail to take advantage of future opportunities or fail to respond to competitive pressures or customer requirements . a lack of sufficient funding may also require us to significantly modify our business model and or reduce or cease our operations , which could include implementing cost-cutting measures or delaying , scaling back or eliminating some or all of our ongoing and planned investments in corporate infrastructure , research and development projects , business development initiatives and sales and marketing activities , among other activities . modification of our business model and operations could result in an impairment of assets , the effects of which can not be determined . furthermore , if we continue to issue equity or convertible debt securities to raise additional funds , our existing stockholders may experience significant dilution , and the new equity or debt securities may have rights , preferences and privileges that are superior to those of our existing stockholders . additionally , if we are not able to maintain the listing of our common stock on the nasdaq capital market , the challenges and risks of equity financings may significantly increase , including potentially increasing the dilution of any such financing or decreasing our ability to effect such a financing at all . if we incur additional debt , it may increase our leverage relative to our earnings or to our equity capitalization or have other material consequences . if we pursue asset or technology sales or licenses or other alternative financing arrangements to obtain additional capital , our operational capacity may be limited and any revenue streams or business plans that are dependent on the sold

the saturday closest to january 31. accordingly , fiscal 2018 represented the 52 weeks ended on february 2 , 2019 . fiscal 2017 represented the 53 weeks ended on february 3 , 2018 . fiscal 2016 represented the 52 weeks ended on january 28 , 2017 . introduction we are a specialty retailer of home décor in the united states , operating 428 stores in 37 states as of february 2 , 2019 , as well as an e-commerce enabled website , www.kirklands.com . our stores present a broad selection of distinctive merchandise , including holiday décor , furniture , art , fragrance and accessories , ornamental wall décor , decorative accessories , mirrors , lamps , textiles , artificial floral products , gifts , housewares , outdoor living items , frames and clocks . our stores offer an extensive assortment of holiday merchandise during seasonal periods as well as items carried throughout the year suitable for gift-giving . we provide our customers with an engaging shopping experience characterized by a diverse , ever-changing merchandise selection reflecting current styles at prices which provide discernible value . this combination of ever-changing and stylish merchandise , value pricing and a stimulating online and store experience has led to our emergence as a leader in home décor and enabled us to develop a strong customer base . overview of key financial measures net sales and gross profit are the most significant drivers of our operating performance . net sales consists of all merchandise sales to customers , net of returns , shipping revenue associated with e-commerce sales , gift card breakage revenue and excludes sales taxes . our net sales for fiscal 2018 increased by 2.0 % to $ 647.1 million from $ 634.1 million in fiscal 2017 . the net sales increase in fiscal 2018 resulted primarily from the net growth in the store base of 10 stores and increased e-commerce sales , partially offset by a decrease in comparable store sales and one additional week in fiscal 2017 that was responsible for approximately $ 10.0 million of net sales . comparable store sales , including the increase in e-commerce sales , decreased 1.3 % for fiscal 2018 on a 52-week basis . we use comparable store sales to measure our ability to achieve sales increases from stores that have been open for at least 13 full fiscal months . stores closed during the year are included in the comparable store sales calculation only for the full fiscal months of the year the stores were open . relocated stores are removed from the comparable store base when the existing store closes , and the new replacement store is added into the comparable store sales calculation after 13 full fiscal months of activity . increases in comparable store sales are an important factor in maintaining or increasing the profitability of existing stores . gross profit is the difference between net sales and cost of sales . cost of sales has various distinct components including : product cost of sales ( including inbound freight , damages and inventory shrinkage and loyalty reward program charges ) , store occupancy costs ( including rent and depreciation of leasehold improvements and other property and equipment ) , outbound freight costs ( including e-commerce shipping ) and central distribution costs ( including operational costs and depreciation of leasehold improvements and other property and equipment ) . product and outbound freight costs are variable , while occupancy and central distribution costs are largely fixed . 24 accordingly , gross profit expressed as a percentage of net sales can be influenced by many factors including overall sales performance . for fiscal 2018 , gross profit decreased 2.2 % to $ 203.1 million from $ 207.5 million for fiscal 2017 . gross profit as a percentage of net sales decreased to 31.4 % for fiscal 2018 from 32.7 % in fiscal 2017 , due primarily to higher store occupancy , outbound freight and central distribution costs . operating expenses , including the costs of operating our stores and corporate headquarters , are also an important component of our operating performance . compensation and benefits comprise the majority of our operating expenses . operating expenses contain fixed and variable costs , and managing the operating expense ratio ( operating expenses expressed as a percentage of net sales ) is an important focus of management as we seek to increase our overall profitability . operating expenses include cash costs as well as non-cash costs such as depreciation and amortization associated with corporate and omni-channel property and equipment . because many operating expenses are fixed costs , and because operating costs tend to rise over time , increases in comparable store sales typically are necessary to prevent meaningful increases in the operating expense ratio . operating expenses can also include certain costs that are of a one-time or non-recurring nature . story_separator_special_tag for each period presented , the amounts of cash used in investing activities consisted principally of capital expenditures related to new store construction , distribution center projects and information technology projects , including investments in our omni-channel systems , and existing store expenditures . the increase in capital expenditures in fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 was primarily due to increased technology projects and corporate lease buyouts , partially offset by less stores opened in fiscal 2018 compared to 2017 . the decrease in capital expenditures in fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016 was primarily due to less new stores opened in fiscal 2017 compared to 2016. during fiscal 2018 , we opened 25 stores compared to 31 stores in fiscal 2017 and 42 stores in fiscal 2016 . cash flows from financing activities . net cash used in financing activities was $ 15.8 million , $ 0.5 million and $ 0.2 million for fiscal 2018 , fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2016 , respectively . during fiscal 2018 , we repurchased and retired approximately $ 15.7 million of common stock compared to approximately $ 0.6 million of shares repurchased and retired during fiscal 2017 and no share repurchases in fiscal 2016. during fiscal 2018 , fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2016 , we did not make any draws on our revolving credit facility . senior credit facility . we are party to a joinder and first amendment to amended and restated credit agreement ( the “ credit agreement ” ) with bank of america , n.a . as administrative agent and collateral agent , and the lenders named herein ( the “ lenders ” ) . the credit agreement includes a senior secured revolving credit facility of $ 75 million , a swingline availability of $ 10 million , 28 a $ 25 million incremental accordion feature and a maturity date of february 2021. borrowings under the credit agreement bear interest at an annual rate equal to libor plus a margin ranging from 125 to 175 basis points with no libor floor , and the fee paid to the lenders on the unused portion of the credit facility is 25 basis points per annum . borrowings under the credit agreement are subject to certain customary conditions and contain customary events of default , including , without limitation , failure to make payments , a cross-default to certain other debt , breaches of covenants , breaches of representations and warranties , a change in control , certain monetary judgments and bankruptcy and erisa events . upon any such event of default , the principal amount of any unpaid loans and all other obligations under the credit agreement may be declared immediately due and payable . the maximum availability under the facility is limited by a borrowing base formula which consists of a percentage of eligible inventory and eligible credit card receivables , less reserves . we are subject to an amended and restated security agreement ( the “ security agreement ” ) with our lenders . pursuant to the security agreement , we pledged and granted to the administrative agent , for the benefit of itself and the secured parties specified therein , a lien on and security interest in all of the rights , title and interest in substantially all of our assets to secure the payment and performance of the obligations under the credit agreement . as of february 2 , 2019 , we were in compliance with the covenants in the credit agreement , and there were no outstanding borrowings under the credit facility , with approximately $ 53.0 million available for borrowing . as of february 2 , 2019 , our balance of cash and cash equivalents was approximately $ 57.9 million . we did not borrow from our credit facility during fiscal 2018 , nor do we expect any borrowings during fiscal 2019 . we believe that the combination of our cash balances and cash flow from operations will be sufficient to fund our planned capital expenditures and working capital requirements for at least the next twelve months . share repurchase authorization . on august 22 , 2017 , we announced that our board of directors authorized a stock repurchase plan providing for the purchase in the aggregate of up to $ 10 million of our outstanding common stock . this stock repurchase plan was completed during the third quarter of fiscal 2018. on september 24 , 2018 , the company announced that its board of directors authorized a new stock repurchase plan providing for the purchase in the aggregate of up to $ 10 million of the company 's outstanding common stock . repurchases of shares are made in accordance with applicable securities laws and may be made from time to time in the open market or by negotiated transactions . the amount and timing of repurchases is based on a variety of factors , including stock acquisition price , regulatory limitations and other market and economic factors . the stock repurchase program does not require us to repurchase any specific number of shares , and we may terminate the repurchase program at any time . as of february 2 , 2019 , we had approximately $ 3.7 million remaining under the current stock repurchase plan . the table below sets forth selected stock repurchase plan information ( in thousands , except share amounts ) for the periods indicated : replace_table_token_9_th contractual obligations not applicable to smaller reporting companies . related party transactions in july 2009 , we entered into a vendor agreement with a related party vendor to purchase merchandise inventory . the vendor is considered a related party because its principal owner is the spouse of our vice president of product development and trends . the table below sets forth selected results related to this vendor in dollars ( in thousands ) and percentages for the periods indicated : replace_table_token_10_th 29 off-balance sheet arrangements our off-balance sheet arrangements are limited to operating leases . we typically lease buildings for retail stores rather than acquiring these assets through purchases .
","results of operations . the table below sets forth selected results of our operations both in dollars ( in thousands ) and as a percentage of net sales for the periods indicated : replace_table_token_7_th net sales . net sales increased 2.0 % to $ 647.1 million in fiscal 2018 compared to $ 634.1 million in fiscal 2017 . the net sales increase of $ 13.0 million in fiscal 2018 resulted primarily from net-new store sales growth of approximately $ 30.9 million partially offset by a decrease in total comparable store sales of approximately $ 7.9 million on a 52-week basis and $ 10.0 million in decreased sales due to one less week in fiscal 2018. on a 52-week basis , comparable store sales , including e-commerce sales , decreased 1.3 % for fiscal 2018 compared to an increase of 0.3 % for fiscal 2017 . in fiscal 2018 , the e-commerce business increased 21.6 % versus the prior year period , while comparable store sales at brick-and-mortar stores decreased 4.1 % on a 52-week basis . the increase in e-commerce comparable sales was due to an increase in website traffic led by a strong increase in transactions partially offset by a decrease in conversion . the decrease in brick-and-mortar comparable stores sales was driven by a decrease in transactions resulting from lower traffic , partially offset by higher conversion . average ticket also increased year-over-year due to a higher average unit retail price . merchandise categories that contributed positively to fiscal 2018 comparable store sales included holiday , outdoor living , floral and fragrance and accessories . merchandise categories performing below last year 's level were art , mirrors , ornamental wall décor and lamps . gross profit . gross profit as a percentage of net sales decreased approximately 130 basis points from 32.7 % in fiscal 2017 to 31.4 % in fiscal 2018 .

"when necessary , certain amounts in prior year financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the current year 's presentation . the following should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes . executive level overview management evaluates the company 's operating results and financial condition using measures that include net income , earnings per share , return on assets and equity , return on tangible common equity , net interest margin , tangible book value per share , asset quality indicators , and many others . these metrics are used by management to make key decisions regarding the company 's balance sheet , liquidity , interest rate sensitivity , and capital resources and assist with identifying opportunities for improving the company 's financial position or operating results . the company is focused on organic growth , but will also consider acquisition opportunities that can provide a satisfactory financial return . the company completed the acquisition of island bancorp inc. ( `` island bancorp '' ) in the second quarter of 2017. interest-earning assets management 's balance sheet strategy emphasizes commercial and home equity lending . the results depicted in the following table reflect an overall increase in total loans over the past five years due to the results of that strategy , as well as the impact from recent acquisitions . organic loan growth in 2017 was driven primarily by increases in the commercial real estate , commercial construction and home equity categories , partly offset by a decline in commercial and industrial related balances . management strives to be disciplined about loan pricing and considers interest rate sensitivity when generating loan assets . the company has gradually and intentionally shifted its balance sheet composition so that its interest-rate risk position is fundamentally asset-sensitive . management takes a disciplined approach to credit underwriting , seeking to avoid undue credit risk and loan losses . 30 funding and the net interest margin the company 's overall sources of funding reflect strong business and retail deposit growth , supporting management 's emphasis on core deposit growth to fund loans , as depicted by the following chart : as of december 31 , 2017 , core deposits comprised 90.1 % of total deposits . the continued emphasis on core deposits has resulted in a cost of deposits of 0.19 % for the year ended 2017 , which is an increase of one basis point when compared to the prior year . the company 's net interest margin was 3.60 % for the year ended december 31 , 2017 , a twenty basis point increase from the prior year , reflecting the company 's asset sensitive position , as shown by the following chart : 31 noninterest income management continues to focus on noninterest income growth , which is primarily comprised of deposit account fees , interchange and atm fees , investment management fees and mortgage banking income . the following chart shows the components of noninterest income over the past five years : expense control management seeks to take a balanced approach to noninterest expense control by monitoring the management of ongoing operating expenses while making needed capital expenditures and prudently investing in growth initiatives . the company 's primary expenses arise from rockland trust 's employee salaries and benefits , as well as expenses associated with buildings and equipment . the following chart depicts the company 's efficiency ratio on a gaap basis ( calculated by dividing noninterest expense by the sum of noninterest income and net interest income ) , as well as the company 's efficiency ratio on a non-gaap operating basis , if applicable , ( calculated by dividing noninterest expense , excluding certain noncore items , by the sum of noninterest income , excluding certain noncore items , and net interest income ) over the past five years : * see `` non-gaap measures '' below for a reconciliation to gaap financial measures . 32 tax effectiveness the company participates in federal and state tax credit programs designed to promote economic development , affordable housing , and job creation . the company continues to participate in the federal new markets tax credit program and has also made low-income housing tax credit investments . the company has also established security corporation subsidiaries and , through its subsidiaries , purchased tax-exempt bonds . federal and state tax credit program participation and other tax strategies help the company operate in a more tax effective manner and sometimes also create a competitive advantage for rockland trust and its community development subsidiaries . during 2017 , the company 's effective tax rate was 35.19 % . the effective tax rate reflected additional tax expense of $ 1.9 million and $ 466,000 associated with the company 's revaluation of net deferred tax assets and low income housing tax credit ( `` lihtc '' ) investments , respectively , as a result of the effects of the tax cuts and jobs act ( `` tax act '' ) . effective january 1 , 2018 , the provisions of the tax act also reduced the maximum federal corporate income tax rate from 35 % to 21 % , which will significantly reduce the company 's effective tax rate in 2018 and future years . capital the company 's disciplined approach with respect to revenue , expense , and tax effectiveness is designed to promote long-term earnings growth . strong earnings growth has resulted in healthy capital growth . book value per share increased 7.37 % in 2017 and has increased 38.4 % over the past four years . in addition , tangible book value per share increased 9.17 % in 2017 compared to the prior year and has increased 49.0 % over the past four years . stockholders ' equity as a percentage of total assets was 11.68 % at december 31 , 2017 , compared to 11.22 % in the prior year . story_separator_special_tag 34 the following table summarizes the impact of noncore items recorded for the time periods indicated below and reconciles them in accordance with gaap : replace_table_token_6_th ( 1 ) the net tax benefit associated with noncore items is determined by assessing whether each noncore item is included or excluded from net taxable income and applying the company 's combined marginal tax rate only to those items included in net taxable income . 35 the following table summarizes the impact of noncore items with respect to the company 's total revenue , noninterest income as a percentage of total revenue , and the efficiency ratio for the periods indicated : replace_table_token_7_th 36 the following table summarizes the calculation of the company 's tangible common equity ratio and tangible book value per share for the periods indicated : replace_table_token_8_th 37 financial position securities portfolio the company 's securities portfolio consists of trading securities , securities available for sale and securities which management intends to hold until maturity . securities increased by $ 95.0 million , or 11.2 % , at december 31 , 2017 as compared to december 31 , 2016 . the increase was attributable to periodic purchases throughout the year , partially offset by paydowns . the ratio of securities to total assets as of december 31 , 2017 was 11.71 % , compared to 11.05 % at december 31 , 2016 . the company monitors investment securities for the presence of other-than-temporary impairment ( “ otti ” ) . for debt securities , the primary consideration in determining whether impairment is otti is whether or not the bank expects to collect all contractual cash flows . further analysis of the company 's otti can be found in note 3 , “ securities ” within notes to consolidated financial statements included in item 8 hereof . 38 the following table sets forth the fair value of available for sale securities and the amortized cost of held to maturity securities along with the percentage distribution : table 1 - securities portfolio composition replace_table_token_9_th the company 's available for sale securities are carried at fair value and are categorized within the fair value hierarchy based on the observability of model inputs . securities which require inputs that are both significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable are classified as level 3 within the fair value hierarchy . as of december 31 , 2017 , 2016 , and 2015 , the company had $ 1.6 million of securities categorized as level 3 within the fair value hierarchy . 39 the following tables set forth contractual maturities of the bank 's securities portfolio at december 31 , 2017 . actual maturities will differ from contractual maturities because borrowers may have the right to call or prepay obligations with or without call or prepayment penalties . weighted average yields in the table below have been calculated based on the amortized cost of the security . table 2 - securities portfolio , amounts maturing replace_table_token_10_th ( 1 ) equity securities have no contractual maturity and typically do not pay contractual interest or dividend income , therefore they are reported above in the over ten year maturity column with no weighted average yield . as of december 31 , 2017 , the weighted average life of the securities portfolio was 5.0 years and the modified duration was 4.4 years . at december 31 , 2017 , the aggregate book value of securities issued by fannie mae and freddie mac exceeded 10 % of stockholders ' equity . the aggregate book value and market value of securities issued by fannie mae at december 31 , 2017 was $ 498.2 million and $ 495.7 million , respectively . the aggregate book value and market value of securities issued by freddie mac at december 31 , 2017 was $ 282.9 million and $ 280.4 million , respectively . 40 residential mortgage loan sales the company 's primary loan sale activity arises from the sale of government sponsored enterprise eligible residential mortgage loans . during 2017 and 2016 , the bank originated residential loans with the intention of selling them in the secondary market or holding them in the company 's residential portfolio . when a loan is sold , the company enters into agreements that contain representations and warranties about the characteristics of the loans sold and their origination . the company may be required to either repurchase mortgage loans or to indemnify the purchaser from losses if representations and warranties are breached . the company has incurred minimal losses during the years ended december 31 , 2017 , 2016 and 2015 related to repurchased loans . the following table shows the total residential loans that were closed and whether the amounts were held in the portfolio or sold/held for sale in the secondary market during the period indicated : table 3 - closed residential real estate loans replace_table_token_11_th the company sold $ 234.2 million and $ 304.3 million in residential loans at december 31 , 2017 and 2016 , respectively . all loans sold during these periods were sold with servicing rights released . currently , the bank sells the servicing of sold loans for a servicing release premium , simultaneous with the sale of the loan . in the past , the bank may have opted to sell loans and retain the servicing . in the event of a sale with servicing rights retained , a mortgage servicing asset is established , which represents the then current estimated fair value based on market prices for comparable mortgage servicing contracts , when available , or alternatively is based on a valuation model that calculates the present value of estimated future net servicing income . the valuation model incorporates assumptions that market participants would use in estimating future net servicing income , such as the cost to service , the discount rate , an inflation rate , ancillary income , prepayment speeds and default rates and losses .
","summary of significant accounting policies ” and note 4 , “ loans , allowance for loan losses and credit quality ” within notes to consolidated financial statements included in item 8 hereof . federal home loan bank stock the bank held an investment in federal home loan bank ( “ fhlb ” ) of boston , of $ 11.6 million and $ 11.5 million at december 31 , 2017 and december 31 , 2016 , respectively . the fhlb is a cooperative that provides services to its member banking institutions . the primary reason for the fhlb of boston membership is to gain access to a reliable source of wholesale funding , particularly term funding , as a tool to manage interest rate risk . the purchase of stock in the fhlb is a requirement for a member to gain access to funding . the company purchases and or is subject to redemption of fhlb stock proportional to the volume of funding received and views the holdings as a necessary long-term investment for the purposes of balance sheet liquidity and not for investment return . 50 goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill and other intangible assets were $ 241.1 million and $ 231.4 million at december 31 , 2017 and december 31 , 2016 , respectively . the increase is due to the island bancorp acquisition , partially offset by amortization of definite-lived intangibles . the company typically performs its annual goodwill impairment testing during the third quarter of the year , unless certain indicators suggest earlier testing to be warranted . the company performed its annual goodwill impairment testing during the third quarter of 2017 and determined that the company 's goodwill was not impaired . other intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable .

this section in conjunction with the business and financial information regarding us as provided in this form 10-k. since the conversion of hometrust bank did not occur until after the june 30 , 2012 fiscal year end , unless otherwise indicated , the financial information presented in this section prior to this date reflects the consolidated financial condition and results of operations of hometrust bank and its subsidiary . overview our principal business consists of attracting deposits from the general public and investing those funds , along with borrowed funds in loans secured primarily by first and second mortgages on one- to four-family residences , including home equity loans and construction and land/lot loans , commercial real estate loans , construction and development loans , and municipal leases . municipal leases are secured primarily by a ground lease for a firehouse or an equipment lease for fire trucks and firefighting equipment to fire departments located throughout north and south carolina . we also purchase investment securities consisting primarily of mortgage-backed securities issued by united states government agencies and government-sponsored enterprises , as well as , certificates of deposit insured by the federal deposit insurance corporation ( “ fdic ” ) . we offer a variety of deposit accounts for individuals , businesses and nonprofit organizations . deposits are our primary source of funds for our lending and investing activities . we adopted a plan of conversion , primarily to increase our capital to grow our loan portfolio organically and through acquisitions and to continue to build our franchise . we are significantly affected by prevailing economic conditions , as well as , government policies and regulations concerning , among other things , monetary and fiscal affairs , housing and financial institutions . deposit flows are influenced by a number of factors , including interest rates paid on competing time deposits , other investments , account maturities , and the overall level of personal income and savings . lending activities are influenced by the demand for funds , the number and quality of lenders , and regional economic cycles . our primary source of pre-tax income is net interest income . net interest income is the difference between interest income , which is the income that we earn on our loans and investments , and interest expense , which is the interest that we pay on our deposits and borrowings . changes in levels of interest rates affect our net interest income . a secondary source of income is noninterest income , which includes revenue we receive from providing products and services , including service charges on deposit accounts , mortgage banking income and gains and losses from sales of securities . our noninterest expenses consist primarily of salaries and employee benefits , expenses for occupancy , marketing and computer services and fdic deposit insurance premiums . salaries and benefits consist primarily of the salaries and wages paid to our employees , payroll taxes , expenses for retirement and other employee benefits . occupancy expenses , which are the fixed and variable costs of buildings and equipment , consist primarily of lease payments , property taxes , depreciation charges , maintenance and costs of utilities . beginning in fiscal year 2009 and continuing throughout much of fiscal year 2012 , housing markets deteriorated in many of our market areas and we experienced significantly higher levels of delinquencies and non-performing assets , primarily in our construction and land development loan portfolios . during this period , home and lot sales activity was exceptionally slow , causing stress on builders ' and developers ' cash flows and their ability to service debt , which was reflected in our increased non-performing asset totals . further , property values generally declined , reducing the value of the collateral securing loans . in addition , other non-housing-related segments of the loan portfolio developed signs of stress and increasing levels of non-accruing loans as the effects of the recent recession became more evident and the pace of the recovery remained slow . as a result , during these periods our provision for loan losses was significantly higher than historical levels and our normal expectations . this higher than normal level of delinquencies and non-accruals also had a material adverse effect on operating income as a result of foregone interest revenues , increased loan collection costs and carrying costs and valuation adjustments for reo . during both fiscal 2013 and 2014 , home and lot sales activity and real estate values have modestly improved 63 along with general economic conditions resulting in materially lower loan charge-offs and write-downs of real estate owned in fiscal 2014. as a result , during the year ended june 30 , 2014 , our provision for loan losses decreased $ 7.4 million primarily due to lower net loan charge-offs and our loss on sale and impairment of real estate owned declined $ 305,000 due to improving real estate values . for the year ended june 30 , 2014 we had net income of $ 10.3 million , as compared to net income of $ 9.1 million for the year ended june 30 , 2013. on july 31 , 2013 , we completed our acquisition of bankgreenville financial corporation ( “ bankgreenville ” ) with one office located in greenville , south carolina . bankgreenville reported total assets of $ 105.1 million , total deposits of $ 90.0 million , and stockholders ' equity of $ 9.6 million at june 30 , 2013. on may 31 , 2014 , we completed our acquisition of jefferson bancshares , inc. , ( “ jefferson ” ) headquartered in morristown , tennessee . story_separator_special_tag we believe the continuing changes in the secondary market as a result of the uncertainty that is surrounding fannie mae and freddie mac will result in increased opportunities in the coming years to originate high quality residential loans with more attractive pricing for our loan portfolio . with our long experience and expertise in residential lending , we believe we can be effective in capturing the opportunities of these market changes in residential lending . expanding our commercial and industrial lending and indirect auto finance line of business . on march 10 , 2014 , hometrust bank hired a new chief credit officer , keith houghton . under mr. houghton 's direction , the bank has expanded its commercial credit department and added new technology systems to support the growth of the bank 's commercial loan portfolio . with our new lpo in roanoke , virginia and the acquisitions of bankgreenville and jefferson , we have expanded our commercial and industrial lending . the expansion and acquisitions have provided us personnel with expertise in commercial and industrial lending , as well as intimate knowledge of the greenville , south carolina , east tennessee , and roanoke valley area markets . additionally , during fiscal year 2014 , hometrust bank added an indirect auto finance line of business . the indirect auto finance group services automobile dealerships , its owners , and consumers buying automobiles through these dealerships mainly in western north carolina and upstate south carolina . our focus on working with strong dealerships will allow us to expand into additional market areas and to actively deepen relationships through cross-selling opportunities , while building a strong reputation . continuing to expand our presence within our existing and contiguous market areas and by capturing business opportunities resulting from changes in the competitive environment . we believe the significant changes that are impacting the financial services industry in the current economic environment , including failures and consolidations of community banks , may create opportunities to grow our business . our increased capital position from our stock offering has positioned us to be able to expand our market presence within our existing geographic footprint at the appropriate time . in the past , we have successfully opened de novo branches and integrated five community banks into the hometrust banking partnership , including the january 31 , 2010 addition of industrial federal bank , the october 1 , 2010 addition of cherryville federal bank , the july 31 , 2013 acquisition of bankgreenville , the may 31 , 2014 acquisition of jefferson bancshares , inc. , and the july 31 , 2014 acquisition of bank of commerce . going forward , while exercising appropriate discipline , we expect to strengthen our market position by capturing a portion of the market share arising from the expected consolidation of community banks in our market areas . we believe that the new regulatory and technology environment , as well as , the revenue and growth challenges in banking , will result in many community banks seeking to affiliate with strongly capitalized larger community banks such as hometrust bank . in addition , by delivering high quality , customer-focused products and services , we expect to attract additional borrowers and depositors and thus increase our market share and revenue generation . emphasizing lower cost core deposits to manage the funding costs of our loan growth . we offer personal checking , savings and money-market accounts , which generally are lower-cost sources of funds than certificates of deposit and are less sensitive to withdrawal when interest rates fluctuate . to build our core deposit base , over the 65 past several years , we have sought to reduce our dependence on traditional higher cost deposits in favor of stable lower cost demand deposits . we have utilized additional product offerings , technology and a focus on customer service in working toward this goal . in addition , we intend to increase demand deposits by growing business banking relationships through a recently expanded product line tailored to our target business customers ' needs . we are also pursuing a number of strategies that include product offerings such as mobile banking and sales promotions on savings and checking accounts to encourage the growth of lower cost deposits . improving profitability through customer growth and balance sheet management . we have focused and are continuing to focus significant efforts on creating brand awareness , offering competitive products and employing a strong and experienced workforce . in order to deepen the relationships with our customers and increase individual customer profitability , we have implemented a new cross-marketing program and further augmented our new account opening process to better identify and discuss the individual customer 's product and service needs . in addition , we have targeted our direct mail campaigns to take advantage of competitor mergers and or branch closures to acquire new customer core deposits . we believe these initiatives have positioned us well to implement a strategy focused on improving revenue growth and non-interest income . hiring and retaining experienced employees with a customer service focus . we have been successful in attracting and retaining banking professionals with strong community relationships and significant knowledge of our markets , through both individual hires and business combinations , which is central to our business strategy . exceptional service , local involvement and timely decision-making are integral parts of our business strategy , and we continue to seek additional highly qualified and motivated individuals . we believe that by focusing on experienced bankers who are established in their communities , we enhance our market position and add profitable growth opportunities . our compensation and incentive systems are aligned with our strategies to grow core deposits and our loan portfolio as the economy improves , while improving asset quality . we have a strong corporate culture based on personal accountability , high ethical standards and significant training opportunities , which is supported by our commitment to career development and promotion from within the organization .
","general . during the year ended june 30 , 2013 , we had net income of $ 9.1 million as compared to net income of $ 4.5 million for the year ended june 30 , 2012. this increase was primarily as a result of the $ 14.5 million decrease in the provision for losses on loans over the prior fiscal year partially offset by a $ 4.7 million increase in noninterest expense . on a basic and diluted per share basis , the company earned $ 0.45 per share for the year ended june 30 , 2013 , while it had no shares outstanding at june 30 , 2012. net interest income . net interest income was $ 53.1 million for the year ended june 30 , 2013 compared to $ 55.7 million for the year ended june 30 , 2012. net interest income decreased $ 2.6 million , or 4.6 % , compared to the same period in the prior year as declines in interest income on loans of $ 7.3 million outpaced a decrease in deposit and other borrowing costs of $ 4.5 million . net interest margin ( on a fully taxable-equivalent basis ) for the year ended june 30 , 2013 decreased 21 basis points to 3.81 % over the same period last year , primarily due to a 52 basis point decrease in the yield on interest-earning assets ( on a fully taxable-equivalent basis ) to 4.30 % , partially offset by a 26 basis point decline in the rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities to 0.65 % . the decline in the yield on interest-earning assets during the year ended june 30 , 2013 was primarily due to declines in both the average balance and tax-equivalent yields on loans receivable . generally , our balance sheet interest rate sensitivity achieves better net interest rate margins in a stable or increasing interest rate environment .

in 2017 , the following financing activities , and impacts to results of operations , are currently anticipated to occur : financing plans - alliant energy currently expects to issue up to $ 150 million of common stock in 2017 through one or more offerings and its shareowner direct plan . both ipl and wpl currently expect to receive capital contributions of approximately $ 150 million from their parent company , alliant energy , in 2017. ipl and wpl currently expect to issue up to $ 250 million and $ 300 million , respectively , of long-term debt securities in 2017. common stock dividends - alliant energy announced an increase in its targeted 2017 annual common stock dividend to $ 1.26 per share , which is equivalent to a quarterly rate of $ 0.315 per share , beginning with the february 2017 dividend payment . the timing and amount of future dividends is subject to an approved dividend declaration from alliant energy 's board of directors , and is dependent upon earnings expectations , capital requirements , and general financial business conditions , among other factors . in addition , ipl and wpl currently expect to pay common stock dividends of approximately $ 156 million and $ 126 million , respectively , to their parent company in 2017. utility electric margins - alliant energy , ipl and wpl currently expect an increase in electric margins in 2017 compared to 2016 as a result of base rate increases in effect from wpl 's recent retail electric rate case and ipl 's planned retail electric rate case . refer to “ rate matters ” for further discussion of these rate cases . other operation and maintenance expenses - alliant energy currently expects its other operation and maintenance expenses to increase in 2017 compared to 2016 primarily due to ipl 's marshalltown facility , which is expected to be placed in service in april 2017 , as well as higher energy delivery infrastructure maintenance expenditures . also contributing to the increase are energy efficiency regulatory amortizations at wpl , which will be offset by increases in wpl 's base rates as discussed in “ rate matters . ” depreciation and amortization expenses - alliant energy currently expects its depreciation and amortization expenses to increase in 2017 compared to 2016 due to property additions , including various environmental controls projects at ipl and wpl placed in service in 2016 and ipl 's marshalltown facility , which is expected to be placed in service in april 2017. refer to “ rate matters ” for discussion of updated depreciation rates for wpl effective january 1 , 2017 as a result of a recently completed depreciation study . interest expense - alliant energy currently expects its interest expense to increase in 2017 compared to 2016 due to financings completed in 2016 and planned in 2017 as discussed above . results of operations overview alliant energy - “ executive overview ” provides an overview of alliant energy 's 2016 and 2015 earnings and the various components of its business . ipl - earnings available for common stock increased $ 30 million in 2016 and $ 4 million in 2015 . story_separator_special_tag alliant energy 's wholesale sales volumes increased 12 % in 2016 and 1 % in 2015 . the increases were primarily due to additional sales from ipl 's wholesale power supply agreement with southern minnesota energy cooperative effective august 1 , 2015. the increases were partially offset by decreased sales to wpl 's partial-requirement wholesale customers that have contractual options to be served by wpl , other power supply sources or the miso market . refer to “ other future considerations ” for discussion of notifications provided to each of ipl and wpl to terminate certain of their wholesale power supply agreements . alliant energy 's bulk power and other sales volume changes were largely due to changes in sales in the wholesale energy markets operated by miso . these changes are impacted by several factors including the availability and dispatch of alliant energy 's egus and electricity demand within these wholesale energy markets . changes in bulk power and other sales revenues were largely offset by changes in fuel-related costs , and therefore , did not have a significant impact on electric margins . 35 electric production fuel and purchased power ( fuel-related ) expenses - fossil fuels , such as natural gas and coal , are burned to produce electricity at egus . the cost of fossil fuels used during each period is included in electric production fuel expense . electricity is also purchased to meet customer demand and these costs are charged to purchased power expense . due to ipl 's cost recovery mechanisms for fuel-related expenses , changes in fuel-related expenses resulted in comparable changes in electric revenues , and therefore , did not have a significant impact on alliant energy 's and ipl 's electric margins . wpl 's cost recovery mechanism for wholesale fuel-related expenses also provides for adjustments to its wholesale electric rates for changes in commodity costs , thereby mitigating impacts of changes to commodity costs on alliant energy 's and wpl 's electric margins . wpl 's cost recovery mechanism for retail fuel-related expenses supports deferrals of amounts that fall outside an approved bandwidth of plus or minus 2 % of forecasted fuel-related expenses determined by the pscw each year . the difference between revenue collected and actual fuel-related expenses incurred within the bandwidth increases or decreases alliant energy 's and wpl 's electric margins . wpl estimates the increase ( decrease ) to electric margins from amounts within the bandwidth were approximately $ 6 million , $ 6 million and ( $ 5 ) million in 2016 , 2015 , and 2014 , respectively . refer to note 2 for discussion of deferred fuel-related costs that were outside the approved bandwidth incurred in 2016 , 2015 and 2014. refer to “ other matters - market risk sensitive instruments and positions ” for further discussion of risks associated with increased fuel-related expenses on wpl 's electric margins . refer to “ rate matters ” and note 1 ( g ) for additional information relating to recovery mechanisms for fuel-related expenses . 2016 vs. 2015 summary - alliant energy 's electric production fuel expense decreased $ 56 million in 2016 primarily due to lower dispatch of ipl 's and wpl 's coal-fired egus during 2016 due to lower wholesale energy market prices and wpl 's retirement of nelson dewey units 1 and 2 in december 2015. the decrease was also due to changes in the under-/over-collection of fuel-related expenses at ipl and lower natural gas prices . these items were partially offset by changes in the under-/over-collection of fuel-related expenses that were outside the approved bandwidth at wpl . alliant energy 's purchased power expense increased $ 72 million in 2016 primarily due to increased volumes purchased resulting from lower dispatch of ipl 's and wpl 's coal-fired egus during 2016 . 2015 vs. 2014 summary - alliant energy 's electric production fuel expense increased $ 20 million in 2015 primarily due to changes in the under-/over-collection of fuel-related expenses that were outside the approved bandwidth at wpl . these items were partially offset by lower dispatch of ipl 's coal-fired egus during 2015 and changes in the under-/over-collection of fuel-related expenses at ipl . alliant energy 's purchased power expense decreased $ 59 million in 2015 primarily due to lower prices for electricity purchased by ipl and wpl from miso wholesale energy markets and decreased volumes purchased due to lower electric sales . the decrease was also due to purchased electric capacity expense at ipl attributed to the previous daec ppa , which expired in february 2014. electric transmission service expense - variances between periods in electric transmission service expense were as follows ( in millions ) : 2016 vs. 2015 summary : alliant energy ipl wpl higher electric transmission service costs billed from itc , atc and miso primarily due to increased electric transmission service rates $ 35 $ 18 $ 17 changes at ipl in the under-/over-collection of electric transmission service expense through the transmission cost rider ( a ) 12 12 — changes in wpl 's costs deferred pursuant to escrow treatment for the difference between actual electric transmission service costs and those costs used to determine rates ( a ) ( 7 ) — ( 7 ) other 3 2 1 $ 43 $ 32 $ 11 36 replace_table_token_20_th ( a ) refer to notes 1 ( g ) and 2 for additional information relating to recovery of electric transmission service expenses . refer to “ other future considerations ” for additional information on sales trends and electric transmission service expense . refer to “ rate matters ” and note 2 for information on electric rate increases in 2017. utility gas margins - gas margins are defined as gas operating revenues less cost of gas sold . management believes that gas margins provide a more meaningful basis for evaluating utility operations than gas operating revenues since cost of gas sold is generally passed through to customers , and therefore , results in changes to gas operating revenues that are comparable to changes in cost of gas sold .
","financial results - alliant energy 's net income and eps attributable to alliant energy common shareowners were as follows ( dollars in millions , except per share amounts ) : replace_table_token_12_th ( a ) amounts reflect the effects of a two-for-one stock split distributed in may 2016. refer to note 7 for additional details . the table above includes eps from continuing operations for utilities , atc and corporate services , and non-regulated and parent , which are non-gaap financial measures . alliant energy believes eps from continuing operations for utilities , atc 30 and corporate services , and non-regulated and parent are useful to investors because they facilitate an understanding of segment performance and trends and provide additional information about alliant energy 's operations on a basis consistent with the measures that management uses to manage its operations and evaluate its performance . lower net income and eps from continuing operations in 2016 compared to 2015 was primarily due to asset valuation charges related to the franklin county wind farm in 2016 , partially offset by higher electric and gas margins , higher afudc ( primarily related to marshalltown ) and losses on sales of ipl 's minnesota electric and gas distribution assets in 2015. refer to “ results of operations ” for additional details regarding the various factors impacting earnings during 2016 , 2015 and 2014 . 2016 overview - in 2016 , alliant energy , ipl and wpl focused on achieving financial objectives and executing their strategic plan . key developments in 2016 include the following : ipl 's expansion of wind generation - in october 2016 , ipl and the iowa office of consumer advocate , among other customer groups , filed a settlement agreement with the iub regarding the appropriate rate-making principles for up to 500 mw of additional wind generation at ipl .

"ccusa , our largest operating segment , accounted for 95 % of our 2013 site rental revenues . the following are certain highlights of our business fundamentals and results as of and for the year ended december 31 , 2013 : potential growth resulting from wireless network expansion and new entrants ◦ we expect wireless carriers will continue their focus on improving network quality and expanding capacity by adding additional antennas or other equipment on our wireless infrastructure . ◦ we expect existing and potential new wireless carrier demand for our wireless infrastructure will result from ( 1 ) next generation technologies , ( 2 ) continued development of mobile internet applications , ( 3 ) adoption of other emerging and embedded wireless devices , ( 4 ) increasing smartphone penetration , ( 5 ) wireless carrier focus on expanding quality and capacity , or ( 6 ) the availability of additional spectrum . ◦ substantially all of our wireless infrastructure can accommodate additional tenancy , either as currently constructed or with appropriate modifications to the structure . ◦ u.s. wireless carriers continue to invest in their networks . ◦ our site rental revenues grew $ 379 million , or 18 % , from the full year 2012 to 2013 . our 2013 site rental revenues growth was impacted by : ▪ our acquisitions in 2012 , including the acquisition of certain subsidiaries of wireless capital partners , llc ( `` wcp acquisition '' ) , the acquisition of nextg networks , inc. ( `` nextg acquisition '' ) , and the t-mobile acquisition ( collectively the `` 2012 acquisitions '' ) and , to a lesser extent , the at & t acquisition ( see note 3 to our consolidated financial statements ) ; and ▪ the fact that we have effectively pre-sold via a firm contractual commitment a significant portion of the modification of the existing installations relating to certain lte upgrades . we have done so by increasing the future contracted revenue above that of a typical escalation over a period of time , typically a three or four year period . as a result , for any given period , the increase in cash revenue may not translate into a corresponding increase in reported revenues from the application of straight-line revenue recognition ( see note 2 to our consolidated financial statements ) . site rental revenues under long-term customer contracts with contractual escalations ◦ initial terms of five to 15 years with multiple renewal periods at the option of the tenant of five to ten years each . ◦ weighted-average remaining term of approximately eight years , exclusive of renewals at the customer 's option , representing approximately $ 22 billion of expected future cash inflows . revenues predominately from large wireless carriers ◦ sprint , t-mobile , at & t , and verizon wireless collectively accounted for 88 % and 86 % of consolidated revenues and site rental revenues , respectively , after giving effect to t-mobile 's acquisition of metro pcs ( completed in april 2013 ) , sprint 's acquisition of clearwire ( completed in july 2013 ) , and at & t 's pending acquisition of leap wireless . see also `` item 1a . risk factors '' and note 17 to our consolidated financial statements . majority of land interests under our towers under long-term control ◦ approximately nine-tenths and three-fourths of our site rental gross margin is derived from towers that we own or control for greater than ten and 20 years , respectively . the aforementioned amounts include towers that reside on land interests that are owned , including fee interests and perpetual easements , which represent more than one-third of our site rental gross margin . relatively fixed wireless infrastructure operating costs ◦ our wireless infrastructure operating costs tend to increase at approximately the rate of inflation and are not typically influenced by new tenant additions . minimal sustaining capital expenditure requirements ◦ sustaining capital expenditures represented less than 2 % of net revenues . debt portfolio with long-dated maturities extended over multiple years , with the majority of such debt having a fixed rate ( see `` item 7a . quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk '' for a further discussion of our debt ) ◦ 66 % of our debt has fixed rate coupons . ◦ our debt service coverage and leverage ratios were comfortably within their respective financial maintenance covenants . see `` item 7. md & a—liquidity and capital resources '' for a further discussion of our debt covenants . 22 significant cash flows from operations ◦ net cash provided by operating activities was $ 1.2 billion . ◦ we believe our core business of providing access to our wireless infrastructure can be characterized as a stable cash flow stream , which we expect to grow as a result of anticipated demand for our wireless infrastructure and contractual escalators . capital allocated to drive long-term stockholder value ( see also `` item 7. md & a—liquidity and capital resources '' ) ◦ historical discretionary investments include ( in no particular order ) : purchasing our common stock , acquiring or constructing wireless infrastructure , acquiring land interests under our towers , improving or structurally enhancing our existing wireless infrastructure , or purchasing , repaying or redeeming our debt . ◦ in addition to the at & t acquisition , described under `` —at & t acquisition and financing '' below , discretionary investments during 2013 included : ▪ discretionary capital expenditures of $ 520.1 million , including wireless infrastructure improvements in order to support additional site rentals , construction of wireless infrastructure , and land purchases . ▪ the purchase of 1.4 million shares of our common stock for $ 99.5 million . ◦ other investing and financing activities during 2013 included the following : ▪ in april 2013 , we refinanced all of the outstanding tranche b term loans , which effectively lowered the credit spread by 75 basis points . in august 2013 , we issued $ 800.0 million of incremental tranche b term loans . story_separator_special_tag those trs assets and operations will continue to be subject , as applicable , to federal and state corporate income taxes and to foreign taxes in the jurisdictions in which such assets and operations are located . our foreign assets and operations ( including our tower operations in puerto rico and australia ) most likely will be subject to foreign income taxes in the jurisdictions in which such assets and operations are located , regardless of whether they are included in a trs or not . to qualify and be taxed as a reit , we will generally be required to distribute at least 90 % of our reit taxable income , after the utilization of our net operating loss carryforwards ( `` nols '' ) , ( determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction and excluding net capital gain ) each year to our stockholders . our determination as to the timing and amount of future dividends that we may make as a reit will be based on a number of factors , including investment opportunities around our core business and our federal net operating losses of approximately $ 2.2 billion ( see note 10 to our consolidated financial statements ) . in connection with completing the steps necessary to qualify to operate as a reit , in december 2013 we de-recognized the net deferred tax assets and liabilities related to the entities included in the reit resulting in a corresponding net non-cash income tax charge of $ 67.4 million . the de-recognition of the deferred tax assets and liabilities was recorded upon completion of all necessary actions to qualify as a reit and receipt of final approval from our board of directors . see notes 10 and 20 to our consolidated financial statements and `` item 1a—risk factors '' for additional information concerning our reit election . announcement of plan to initiate common stock dividend in february 2014 , our board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $ 0.35 per share to our common stockholders , which is expected to result in an annual aggregate payment of $ 470 million . see notes 12 and 20 to our consolidated financial statements . 24 results

25 % , from 2012 . this increase predominately resulted from the fixed asset and intangible asset additions related to the nextg acquisition and the t-mobile acquisition . interest expense and amortization of deferred financing costs decreased $ 11.4 million , or 2 % , from 2012 to 2013 , as a result of our refinancings during 2012 and 2013 , partially offset by additional borrowings to fund the 2012 acquisitions and the at & t acquisition . during 2012 and 2013 , we completed several debt transactions , resulting in ( 1 ) lowering our average cost of debt , ( 2 ) funding for our

'' during 2015 , the company implemented rate changes in thirteen states . in california , the following rate increases were implemented : ▪ in may , a 6.4 % rate increase on its preferred private passenger automobile line of insurance business , which represented approximately 50 % of the total company net premiums earned . ▪ in august , a 6.9 % rate increase on its standard private passenger automobile line of insurance business , which represented approximately 15 % of the total company net premiums earned . in april 2010 , the california doi ( `` cdi '' ) issued a notice of non-compliance ( `` 2010 nnc '' ) to mic , mcc , and caic based on a report of examination of the rating and underwriting practices of these companies issued by the cdi in february 2010. the 2010 nnc included allegations of 35 instances of noncompliance with applicable california insurance law and sought to require that each of mic , mcc , and caic change its rating and underwriting practices to rectify the alleged noncompliance and reserved the right to seek monetary penalties . in april 2010 , the company submitted a statement of compliance and notice of defense to the cdi , in which it denied the allegations contained in the 2010 nnc and provided specific defenses to each allegation . the company also requested a hearing in the event that the statement of compliance and notice of defense did not establish to the satisfaction of the cdi that the alleged noncompliance did not exist , and the matters described in the 2010 nnc were not able to be resolved informally with the cdi . while continuing to dispute the cdi 's allegations , the company implemented various changes requested by the cdi and engaged in settlement discussions in the interest of avoiding further litigation . on march 2 , 2015 , mic , mcc and caic entered into an agreement with the cdi , pursuant to which all allegations in the 2010 nnc were settled for $ 1 million , which was subsequently paid , and the case was resolved . in march 2006 , the cdi issued an amended notice of non-compliance to a notice of non-compliance originally issued in february 2004 ( as amended , `` 2004 nnc '' ) alleging that the company charged rates in violation of the california insurance code , willfully permitted its agents to charge broker fees in violation of california law , and willfully misrepresented the actual price insurance consumers could expect to pay for insurance by the amount of a fee charged by the consumer 's insurance broker . the cdi sought to impose a fine for each policy on which the company allegedly permitted an agent to charge a broker fee , to impose a penalty for each policy on which the company allegedly used a misleading advertisement , and to suspend certificates 31 of authority for a period of one year . in january 2012 , the administrative law judge ( the `` alj '' ) bifurcated the 2004 nnc between ( a ) the cdi 's order to show cause ( the `` osc '' ) , in which the cdi asserts the false advertising allegations and accusation , and ( b ) the cdi 's notice of noncompliance , in which the cdi asserts the unlawful rate allegations . in february 2012 , the alj submitted a proposed decision dismissing the nnc , based on conduct by the cdi and the commissioner in violation of the company 's due process rights . specifically , the alj found that the cdi 's attorneys and the commissioner engaged in improper ex parte communication , and commenced a rule making in order to supersede unfavorable evidentiary rulings by the alj . the commissioner rejected the alj 's proposed decision . the company challenged the rejection in los angeles superior court in april 2012 , but the challenge was unsuccessful . the court did not rule on the merits of the alj 's due process concerns , but merely held that the company was required to exhaust its administrative remedies before seeking relief in the superior court . the case was referred back to the alj , and the due process issues raised by the alj 's dismissal were preserved for later appeal .
","results of operations year ended december 31 , 2015 compared to year ended december 31 , 2014 revenues net premiums written and net premiums earned in 2015 increased 5.6 % and 5.8 % , respectively , from 2014 . the increase in net premiums written was primarily due to higher average premiums per policy arising from rate increases in the california private passenger automobile line of insurance business and growth in the number of homeowner policies written in california and private passenger automobile policies written in several states outside of california . net premiums written is a non-gaap financial measure which represents the premiums charged on policies issued during a fiscal period less any applicable reinsurance . net premiums written is a statutory measure designed to determine production levels . net premiums earned , the most directly comparable gaap measure , represents the portion of net premiums written that is recognized as revenue in the financial statements for the period presented and earned on a pro-rata basis over the term of the policies . the following is a reconciliation of total net premiums written to net premiums earned : replace_table_token_18_th expenses loss and expense ratios are used to interpret the underwriting experience of property and casualty insurance companies . the following table presents the insurance companies ' consolidated loss , expense , and combined ratios determined in accordance with gaap : replace_table_token_19_th ( 1 ) combined ratio for 2014 does not sum due to rounding . loss ratio is calculated by dividing losses and loss adjustment expenses by net premiums earned . the company 's loss ratio was affected by unfavorable development of approximately $ 13 million and favorable development of approximately $ 3 million on prior accident years ' losses and loss adjustment expense reserves for the years ended december 31 , 2015 and 2014 , respectively .

"much of our domestic hourly labor force is represented by labor unions with collective bargaining agreements that expire at various dates during 2013 through 2015 , which historically have been extended without disruption . costs of contract revenues vary significantly depending on the type and location of work performed and assets utilized . generally , capital projects have the highest margins due to the complexity of the projects , while coastal protection projects have the most volatile margins because they are most often exposed to variability in weather conditions . the company 's cost structure includes significant annual equipment related costs , including depreciation , maintenance , insurance and long-term equipment rentals , averaging approximately 21 % to 25 % of total costs of contract revenues over the last three years . during the year , both equipment utilization and the timing of cost expenditures fluctuate significantly . accordingly , the company allocates these equipment costs to interim periods in proportion to revenues recognized over the year to better match revenues and expenses . specifically , at each interim reporting date the company compares actual revenues earned to date on the company 's dredging contracts to expected annual revenues and recognizes equipment costs on the same proportionate basis . in the fourth quarter , any over or under allocated equipment costs are recognized such that the expense for the year equals actual equipment costs incurred during the year . as a result of this methodology , the recorded expense in any interim period may be higher or lower than the actual equipment costs incurred in that interim period . primary factors that determine operating profitability dredging . the company 's results of operations for its dredging segment for a calendar or quarterly period are generally determined by the following three factors : bid wins and dredge employment the company 's dredging segment generates revenues when the company wins a bid for a dredging contract and starts that project . although the company 's dredging equipment is subject to downtime for scheduled periodic maintenance and repair , the company seeks to maximize its revenues by employing its dredging equipment on a full-time basis . if a dredge is idle ( i.e. , the dredge is not employed on a dredging project or undergoing scheduled periodic maintenance and repair ) , the company does not earn revenue with respect to that dredge during the time period for which it is idle . project and dredge mix the company 's domestic dredging projects generally involve domestic capital , maintenance and coastal protection work and its foreign dredging projects generally involve capital work . in addition , the company 's dredging projects vary in duration and , in general , projects of longer duration result in less dredge downtime in a given period . moreover , the company 's dredges have different physical capabilities and typically work on certain types of dredging projects . accordingly , the company 's dredges have different daily revenue generating capacities . the company generally expects to achieve different levels of gross margin ( i.e. , gross profit divided by revenues ) for work performed on the different types of dredging projects and for work performed by different types of dredges . the company 's expected gross margin for a project is based upon the company 's estimates at the time of the bid . although the company seeks to bid on and win projects that will maximize its gross margin , the company can not control the type of dredging projects that are available for bid from time to time , the type of dredge that is needed to complete these projects or the time schedule upon which these projects are required to be completed . as a result , in some quarters the company works on a mix of dredging projects that , in the aggregate , have relatively high expected gross margins ( based on project type and dredges employed ) and in other quarters , the company works on a mix of dredging projects that , in the aggregate , have relatively low expected gross margins ( based on project type and dredges employed ) . 37 project execution the company seeks to execute all of its dredging projects consistent with its project estimates . in general , the company 's ability to achieve its project estimates depends upon many factors including weather , variances from estimated project conditions , equipment mobilization time periods , unplanned equipment downtime or other events or circumstances beyond the company 's control . if the company experiences any of these events and circumstances , the completion of a dredging project will often be accelerated or delayed , as applicable , and , consequently , the company will experience project results that are better or worse than its estimates . the company does its best to estimate for events and circumstances that are not within its control ; however , these situations are inherent in dredging . demolition . the company 's demolition segment generates revenues when the company is awarded a contract for demolition services and starts the project . the company 's revenues from its demolition segment increase or decrease based upon market demand . like the company 's dredging segment , results of operations for the company 's demolition segment fluctuate based upon project mix and the company 's ability to execute its projects consistent with its estimates . critical accounting policies and estimates our significant accounting policies are discussed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements . the application of certain of these policies requires significant judgments or an estimation process that can affect the company 's results of operations , financial position and cash flows , as well as the related footnote disclosures . the company bases its estimates on historical experience and other assumptions that it believes are reasonable . if actual amounts are ultimately different from previous estimates , the revisions are included in the company 's results of operations for the period in which the actual amounts become known . story_separator_special_tag adjusted ebitda is not a measure derived in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america ( gaap ) . the company presents adjusted ebitda as an additional measure by which to evaluate the company 's operating trends . the company believes that adjusted ebitda is a measure frequently used to evaluate performance of companies with substantial leverage and that the company 's primary stakeholders ( i.e. , its stockholders , bondholders and banks ) use adjusted ebitda to evaluate the company 's period to period performance . additionally , management believes that adjusted ebitda provides a transparent measure of the company 's recurring operating performance and allows management to readily view operating trends , perform analytical comparisons and identify strategies to improve operating performance . for this reason , the company uses a measure based upon adjusted ebitda to assess performance for purposes of determining compensation under the company 's incentive plan . adjusted ebitda should not be considered an alternative to , or more meaningful than , amounts determined in accordance with gaap including : ( a ) operating income as an indicator of operating performance ; or ( b ) cash flows from operations as a measure of liquidity . as such , the company 's use of adjusted ebitda , instead of a gaap measure , has limitations as an analytical tool , including the inability to determine profitability or liquidity due to the exclusion of accelerated maintenance expense for new international deployments , interest and income tax expense and the associated significant cash requirements and the exclusion of depreciation and amortization , which represent significant and unavoidable operating costs given the level of indebtedness and capital expenditures needed to maintain the company 's business . for these reasons , the company uses operating income to measure the company 's operating performance and uses adjusted ebitda only as a supplement . the following is a reconciliation of adjusted ebitda to net income attributable to great lakes dredge & dock corporation : replace_table_token_14_th 40 components of contract revenues the following table sets forth , by segment and type of work , the company 's contract revenues for the years ended december 31 ( in thousands ) : replace_table_token_15_th * rivers & lakes was established by the company on december 31 , 2010 in connection with the matteson acquisition , and did not operate as part of the company prior to january 1 , 2011. year ended december 31 , 2012 compared to year ended december 31 , 2011 total revenue was $ 687.6 million in 2012 , an increase of $ 60.3 million , or 9.6 % , from 2011 total revenue of $ 627.3 million . dredging contract revenues for 2012 are net of $ 1.4 million in intersegment revenues . demolition contract revenues for 2012 are net of $ 0.1 million in intersegment revenues . higher domestic and foreign capital dredging revenue as well as maintenance revenues were driven by strong execution on prior year backlog and early stages of mobilization for the wheatstone lng project in western australia . the increases in total revenue were partially offset by declines in coastal protection revenues with fewer contracts performed in 2012 as compared to the larger than normal number of contracts performed in 2011 and in demolition revenues . the company categorizes revenue by service type to understand the market in which the company operates and to assess how the company is performing on bidding work or projects and is generating revenue from backlog . revenues from domestic capital dredging projects of $ 175.3 million in 2012 increased $ 19.0 million , or 12.2 % , from 2011 revenues of $ 156.3 million . the company executed substantially its entire backlog from 2011 in addition to 82 % of the awards won in 2012. coastal restoration projects in louisiana added $ 58.4 million to domestic capital dredging revenue in the current year , compared to $ 2.2 million in the prior year . this increase was partially offset by a greater number of domestic capital projects worked in the prior year , including the remaining work on the construction of sand berms off the coast of louisiana , which accounted for approximately $ 20.6 million of 2011 revenue that did not reoccur in 2012. revenues from coastal protection projects of $ 126.9 million in 2012 decreased $ 8.3 million , or 6.1 % , from $ 135.2 million in 2011. a significant increase in coastal protection projects were bid and awarded in 2011. the company was able to convert a portion of these prior year awards into revenue in 2011 as the dredging work was performed and revenue was earned . in 2012 , less bids for coastal protection were let to bid and they were awarded later in year causing fewer days in which to earn revenue . additionally , the company performed emergency work in new york city after superstorm sandy that deferred some of the ongoing coastal protection projects . revenues from maintenance dredging projects in 2012 were $ 136.6 million , an increase of $ 20.6 million , or 17.8 % , from $ 116.0 million in 2011. the company performed a greater number of contracts at a larger dollar value in 2012 as compared to the prior year . an increased backlog at december 31 , 2011 combined with larger dollar value of contracts awarded and strong execution contributed to increase the revenue from maintenance dredging year over year . this increase in revenue was partially muted by atypically high revenue in the first half of 2011 as the company performed maintenance projects that had been delayed from 2010 .
","overview the company is the largest provider of dredging services in the united states . in addition , the company is the only u.s. dredging service provider with significant international operations , which represented 19 % of its dredging revenues for 2012. dredging generally involves the enhancement or preservation of the navigability of waterways or the protection of shorelines through the removal or replenishment of soil , sand or rock . the u.s. dredging market consists of three primary types of work : capital , coastal protection ( formerly referred to as beach nourishment ) and maintenance . capital projects include large port deepenings and other infrastructure projects such as land reclamations . coastal protection projects include rebuilding of shoreline areas that have been damaged by storm activity or ongoing erosion . maintenance projects include routine dredging of ports , rivers and channels to remove the regular build up of sediment . with the acquisition of l.w . matteson , inc. ( matteson ) assets on december 31 , 2010 , the company began to provide the following rivers & lakes services in 2011 : lake and river dredging , inland levee and construction dredging , environmental restoration and habitat improvement and other marine construction . on december 31 , 2012 , the company acquired the assets and assumed certain liabilities of terra , a respected provider of a wide variety of essential services for environmental , maintenance and infrastructure-related applications headquartered in kalamazoo , mi , for a purchase price of approximately $ 26 million . the terra acquisition has broadened the company 's demolition segment with additional services and expertise as well as expanded its footprint in the midwest . the company 's bid market is defined as the aggregate dollar value of domestic projects on which the company bid or could have bid if not for capacity constraints ( bid market ) .

"recycled solutions , made from both pre-consumer and post-consumer waste , include flake and chip . nylon yarns include virgin or recycled textured , solution dyed and spandex covered yarns . unifi maintains one of the textile industry 's most comprehensive yarn product offerings that include specialized yarns , pva yarns and commodity yarns , with principal geographic markets in the americas and asia . unifi has direct manufacturing operations in four countries and participates in joint ventures in israel and the united states , the most significant of which is a 34 % non-controlling partnership interest in pal , a significant unconsolidated affiliate that produces cotton and synthetic yarns for sale to the global textile industry and apparel market . we believe the investment in pal provides strategic diversification for our overall business in response to global textile trends . unifi has three reportable segments - the polyester segment , the nylon segment and the international segment – as well as certain ancillary operations that include for-hire transportation services , which comprise an all other category . the ancillary operations classified within all other are insignificant for all periods presented ; therefore , our discussion and analysis of those activities is generally limited to their impact on consolidated results , where appropriate . unifi reported net income of $ 31,702 , or $ 1.70 per diluted share , for fiscal 2018. these results primarily reflect the benefits of ( i ) growth in sales of pva products , especially in the international segment and ( ii ) an effective tax rate lower than recent prior years due primarily to the reversal of both a significant uncertain tax position and a valuation allowance on certain historical nols . the benefits to net income were partially offset by ( a ) an increasing raw materials cost environment coupled with a challenging domestic landscape in which achieving corresponding selling price adjustments was difficult against cost-competitive imports and ( b ) increased sg & a expenses for talent acquisition , marketing and commercial expansion . in both fiscal 2017 and 2018 , unifi faced periods of fluctuating and or increasing virgin and recycled polyester raw material costs , depressing the polyester segment 's gross margins . additionally , the polyester and nylon segments both experienced a difficult domestic environment , challenged by weak retail selling seasons , highly competitive imports and , through the first half of fiscal 2018 , cautious ordering patterns from brands and retailers . however , the international segment exhibited strong performance and growth due to the global success of unifi 's pva portfolio . significant developments and trends unifi 's operations in fiscal 2018 were focused on enhancing the global supply chain , growing the market for its pva products and using cash flow from operations to fund select capital projects and strategic growth opportunities while also building out our commercial and management team through talent recruitment . this focus led to the continuing increase in unifi 's pva sales as a percentage of its overall sales , with net sales from pva products representing approximately 45 % of consolidated net sales for fiscal 2018. this increase continues a growth trend in pva sales , which have risen more than 10 % annually for the past several fiscal years . unifi 's strategy of enriching its product mix through a focus on pva products helps to insulate it from the pressures of low-priced commodity yarn imports and to establish unifi as an innovation leader in its core markets . unifi 's innovative and sustainable products achieved growth in overseas markets , continuing to meet the demands of premier brands and retailers worldwide . unifi 's flagship repreve ® brand continued as our fastest growing pva solution during fiscal 2018. the increasing success and awareness of the repreve ® brand continues to provide new opportunities for growth , allowing for expansion into new end uses and markets for repreve ® , as well as continued growth of the brand with current customers . both brands and consumers are demanding more sustainable solutions that provide better performance characteristics , and we believe repreve ® is positioned to benefit from this trend . however , despite the relative growth in pva sales and overall sales , unifi experienced profitability challenges in fiscal 2018. the primary challenges related to ( i ) persistently rising raw material costs and an inherent lag in implementing responsive price increases , ( ii ) suppressed yarn demand in the polyester and nylon segments and ( iii ) a less-profitable sales mix . fiscal 2017 marked the final year of a three-year $ 135,000 capital investment plan . beginning with fiscal 2015 , unifi invested approximately $ 35,000 in capital projects , adding machinery to support expansion of its draw-textured and air-jet textured 20 businesses , launching its third production line in the repreve ® recycling center and installing a 1-megawatt capacity solar farm . in fiscal 2016 , unifi invested approximately $ 60,000 in capital projects , including initial construction of a bottle processing facility , commencing another repreve ® recycling center expans ion and enhancing automation systems and existing machinery to accommodate an increasingly complex product mix . unifi invested approximately $ 40,000 in capital projects in fiscal 2017 , completing construction of its bottle processing facility , nearing comp letion of the fourth production line in the repreve ® recycling center , and completing construction of assets for production of specialized bi-component fibers , along with additional enhancements to existing assets for customized and small-lot solutions . in fiscal 2018 , we invested approximately $ 25,000 in capital projects , which included ( i ) completing the fourth production line in the repreve ® recycling center , ( ii ) making further improvements in production capabilities and technology enhancements in the americas and ( iii ) annual maintenance capital expenditures . story_separator_special_tag ebitda , adjusted ebitda , adjusted net income , adjusted eps and adjusted working capital ( collectively , the “ non-gaap financial measures ” ) are not determined in accordance with gaap and should not be considered a substitute for performance measures determined in accordance with gaap . the calculations of the non-gaap financial measures are subjective , based on management 's belief as to which items should be included or excluded in order to provide the most reasonable and comparable view of the underlying operating performance of the business . we may , from time to time , modify the amounts used to determine our non-gaap financial measures . when applicable , management 's discussion and analysis includes specific consideration for items that comprise the reconciliations of its non-gaap financial measures . we believe that these non-gaap financial measures better reflect unifi 's underlying operations and performance and that their use , as operating performance measures , provides investors and analysts with a measure of operating results unaffected by differences in capital structures , capital investment cycles and ages of related assets , among otherwise comparable companies . 22 management uses adjusted ebitda ( i ) as a measurement of operating performance because it assists us in comparing our operating performance on a consistent basis , as it removes the impact of ( a ) items directly related to our asset base ( primarily depreciation and amortization ) and ( b ) items that we would not expect to occur as a part of our normal business on a regular basis ; ( ii ) for planning purposes , including the p reparation of our annual operating budget ; ( iii ) as a valuation measure for evaluating our operating performance and our capacity to incur and service debt , fund capital expenditures and expand our business ; and ( iv ) as one measure in determining the value of other acquisitions and dispositions . adjusted ebitda is a key performance metric utilized in the determination of variable compensation . we also believe adjusted ebitda is an appropriate supplemental measure of debt service capacity , because it serves as a high-level proxy for cash generated from operations and is relevant to our fixed charge coverage ratio . equity in earnings of pal is excluded from adjusted ebitda because such results do not reflect our operating performance . management uses adjusted net income and adjusted eps ( i ) as measurements of net operating performance because they assist us in comparing such performance on a consistent basis , as they remove the impact of ( a ) items that we would not expect to occur as a part of our normal business on a regular basis and ( b ) components of the provision for income taxes that we would not expect to occur as a part of our underlying taxable operations ; ( ii ) for planning purposes , including the preparation of our annual operating budget ; and ( iii ) as measures in determining the value of other acquisitions and dispositions . management uses adjusted working capital as an indicator of unifi 's production efficiency and ability to manage inventory and receivables . historically , the non-gaap financial measures aimed to exclude the impact of the non-controlling interest in renewables , while the consolidated amounts for such entity were required to be included in unifi 's financial amounts reported under gaap . see “ — non-gaap reconciliations ” below for reconciliations of non-gaap metrics to the most directly

ended december 31 , 2015 . the $ 36 million increase is primarily due to a 23.3 % increase in total marcellus sales volumes , partially offset by a 10.5 % decrease in the average gas sales price in the period-to-period comparison . the increase in total sales volumes is primarily due to additional wells coming on-line in the current year , as well as the termination of the marcellus joint venture that consol energy had with noble energy ( see note 9 - property , plant and equipment in the notes to the audited consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this form 10-k for additional

"derivative instruments and hedging activities the company records its derivatives in accordance with asc 815 , derivatives and hedging. the guidance requires the company to recognize derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities in the balance sheet at fair value . the accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use and designation of the derivative instrument . for a derivative designated story_separator_special_tag the following discussion of historical results of operations and financial condition should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements and the notes thereto which appear elsewhere in this report . overview pca is the fourth largest producer of containerboard and corrugated products in the united states , based on production capacity . we operate four containerboard mills and 71 corrugated products manufacturing plants throughout the united states . approximately 80 % of the containerboard tons produced at our mills are consumed in our corrugated products manufacturing plants . the remaining 20 % is sold to domestic customers or the export market . we produce a wide variety of corrugated products ranging from basic corrugated shipping containers to specialized packaging such as wax-coated boxes for the agriculture industry . we also have multi-color printing capabilities to make high-impact graphics boxes and displays that offer our customers more attractive packaging . in analyzing our operating performance , we focus on the following factors that affect our business and are important to consider when reviewing our financial and operating results : containerboard and corrugated products demand ; corrugated products and containerboard pricing and mix ; 17 cost trends and volatility for our major costs , including wood and recycled fiber , purchased fuels , electricity , labor and fringe benefits and transportation costs ; and cash flow from operations and capital expenditures . historically , supply and demand , as well as industry-wide inventory levels , have influenced prices of containerboard and corrugated products . in addition to u.s. shipments , approximately 10 % of domestically produced containerboard has been exported for use in other countries . the market for containerboard and corrugated products is generally subject to changes in the u.s. economy . the u.s. economy grew at a slower rate in 2011 than it did in 2010 as real gdp increased 1.7 % in 2011 compared to a 3.0 % increase in 2010 as reported by the u. s. department of commerce . industry-wide corrugated products shipments increased 0.5 % in 2011 compared to 2010 and containerboard production was 0.3 % higher than in 2010 as reported by industry trade publications . pca experienced improvement in demand that exceeded the industry average , and for the year , our corrugated products shipments were up 5.0 % compared to 2010 , and containerboard production increased from 2,443,000 tons to 2,499,000 tons , or up 2.3 % setting a new record for annual production . industry containerboard inventories at the end of december 2011 were 2.35 million tons , more than 65,000 tons below the ten-year average for year-ending levels . average prices for containerboard and corrugated products were higher during 2011 compared to 2010 , reflecting a full year of the two published price increases that occurred in 2010. during 2011 the published price in industry trade publications for containerboard did not change . increased pricing and improved demand favorably impacted pca 's 2011 earnings compared to 2010. however , they were offset by higher costs for transportation , chemicals , fiber , labor and other input items . published recycled fiber costs in 2011 increased , on average , approximately 20 % compared to 2010. at the end of 2011 , published recycled fiber prices did decline and entered 2012 below the 2011 average price . wood fiber costs in 2011 were essentially unchanged from 2010 levels as weather conditions in the u.s. south were favorable for access to wood fiber . transportation costs increased 9 % from prior year levels as average diesel prices , as reported by the u.s. department of energy , increased 28 % from the 2010 average price . labor related costs increased reflecting annual merit increases and increased costs for medical insurance and workers ' compensation . our prices paid for purchased fuels and electricity each averaged approximately 5 % higher for 2011 compared to the 2010 average . as disclosed in note 16 to the consolidated financial statements , pca is a producer of black liquor , which is considered an alternative fuel when mixed with diesel , making the black liquor an alternative fuel eligible for a $ 0.50 per gallon refundable alternative fuel mixture tax credit through december 31 , 2009. in an irs memorandum released during the second quarter of 2010 , the irs concluded that black liquor also qualifies for the taxable cellulosic biofuel producer credit of $ 1.01 per gallon of biofuel produced in 2009. in a subsequent memorandum , the irs concluded that a black liquor producer may claim the alternative fuel mixture credit and the cellulosic biofuel producer credit in the same taxable year for different volumes of black liquor ( the same gallon of fuel can not receive both credits , but different gallons of fuel can be claimed as either the alternative fuel mixture credit or the cellulosic biofuel producer credit ) . pca received the required cellulosic biofuel producer registration code in september 2010. prior to the irs 's memoranda and guidance regarding the cellulosic biofuel producer credits , pca had recorded all tax credits resulting from black liquor production before december 31 , 2009 as alternative fuel mixture tax credits , resulting in $ 171.3 million in income in 2009 and an additional $ 9.2 million in the first quarter of 2010. based upon both irs memoranda and the 2010 guidance regarding the cellulosic biofuel producer credit , pca analyzed the additional potential benefits from claiming the cellulosic biofuel producer credit for 2009 instead of the alternative fuel mixture credit , or claiming a combination of the two credits for 2009. for the gallons of alternative fuels produced in 2009 , pca claimed about two-thirds story_separator_special_tag gross profit increased $ 105.6 million , or 24.8 % , for the year ended december 31 , 2010 from the year ended december 31 , 2009. gross profit as a percentage of net sales increased from 19.9 % of net sales in the year ended december 31 , 2009 to 21.9 % of net sales in the year ended december 31 , 2010 primarily due to the increases of sales prices and volume described previously . selling and administrative expenses increased $ 9.0 million , or 5.2 % for the year ended december 31 , 2010 from the year ended december 31 , 2009 , primarily as a result of increased salary expense ( $ 6.1 million ) including annual merit increases , incentive compensation , and temporary labor , labor related benefits ( $ 1.0 million ) , travel and meeting costs ( $ 1.1 million ) and broker commissions ( $ 0.7 million ) . corporate overhead for the year ended december 31 , 2010 increased $ 3.5 million , or 6.4 % , from the year ended december 31 , 2009. the increase was primarily attributable to increased salary and fringe benefit expenses ( $ 2.3 million ) and costs for professional services regarding legal , tax and audit matters ( $ 1.2 million ) . other expense , net , increased $ 5.4 million , or 37.4 % for the year ended december 31 , 2010 compared to the year ended december 31 , 2009. the increase was primarily due to closure costs at two facilities ( $ 4.2 million ) and costs related to the write-off of paper machine assets at tomahawk ( $ 2.8 million ) , partially offset by reduced expenses related to legal claims ( $ 1.5 million ) . 22 interest expense , net and income taxes net interest expense decreased by $ 3.2 million , or 9.0 % , for the year ended december 31 , 2010 compared to the year ended december 31 , 2009 , primarily as a result of higher capitalized interest ( $ 3.9 million ) related to the counce and valdosta major energy optimization projects during the year ended december 31 , 2010 compared to the same period in 2009. due to the impact of recording the fuel tax credits , pca 's effective tax rate was ( 34.2 % ) for the year ended december 31 , 2010 and 16.1 % for the year ended december 31 , 2009. excluding the impact of the fuel tax credits , the effective tax rate would have been 34.5 % for the year ended december 31 , 2010 and 36.3 % for the same period in 2009. the effective tax rate varies from the u.s. federal statutory tax rate of 35.0 % principally due to the impact of the fuel tax credits , state and local income taxes and the domestic manufacturers ' deduction . pca recorded a material change in its uncertain tax positions under asc 740 , income taxes ,  of $ 102.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2010 due to the amendment of the 2009 federal income tax return to claim gallons of alternative fuel produced at the filer city , michigan mill . due to the proprietary nature of the biofuel process at the filer city mill , uncertainty as to total fuel gallons qualifying for the credit exists , which caused the additional reserve . pending the timing and the outcome of the irs review that is currently under way , which is not determinable at this time , the reserve for uncertain tax positions could change significantly . liquidity and capital resources replace_table_token_9_th operating activities net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december 31 , 2011 was $ 345.5 million compared to $ 349.9 million for the year ended december 31 , 2010 , a decrease of $ 4.4 million , or 1.3 % . net income , excluding the income from the tax credits ( described in note 16 to the financial statements included in this report ) of $ 47.7 million in 2010 , was $ 158.0 million and $ 157.7 million , respectively , for 2011 and 2010. depreciation , depletion and amortization expense was higher by $ 7.7 million ( primarily due to increased depreciation from the recently-completed major energy projects ) and requirements for operating assets and liabilities were lower by $ 14.1 million in 2011 compared to 2010 , which increased net cash provided by operating activities . the change in operating assets and liabilities was primarily due to an improvement in accounts receivable ( $ 33.3 million ) resulting from price increases in 2010 and favorable changes in inventory ( $ 20.0 million ) in 2011 compared to 2010 due to a 2010 build in inventory in anticipation of the downtime related to the major energy project work completed in 2011. this was partially offset by unfavorable changes in accounts payable ( $ 26.1 million ) and higher pension contributions ( $ 6.9 million ) in 2011 compared to 2010. in addition , pca utilized fewer alternative fuel mixture and cellulosic biofuel producer credits to reduce federal tax payments in 2011 than it did in 2010 , resulting in higher cash taxes paid ( $ 33.6 million ) in 2011 compared to the same period in 2010. cash requirements for operating activities are subject to pca 's operating needs , the timing of collection of receivables and payments of payables and expenses , and seasonal fluctuations in its operations . net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december 31 , 2010 was $ 349.9 million compared to $ 306.1 million for the year ended december 31 , 2009 , an increase of $ 43.8 million , or 14.3 % .

work stoppages , strikes , etc. , which could disrupt shipments to these customers , make forecasting difficult . the integration of the homelink ® business will continue to occur over the next 12 to 18 months . many factors , though not currently expected , could introduce additional risks to the business including customer approvals and support that , if not received , could have a negative impact on the company and future performance . examples of risk associated with customer support and approvals are in the areas of manufacturing changes , purchase order changes , freight and logistics changes , sourcing awards for new and replacement programs and quality approvals and sign-offs . in addition , we will face risks in regard to our ability to own and operate all facets of the homelink ® business , including support from suppliers and compatibility partners , manufacturing skills , equipment and know-how , capacity constraints , electronic ordering systems , inventory levels , shipping and logistics systems , and invoicing/payment systems . moreover , there are inherent business risks associated with disruptive technologies , consumer preference changes , macro-economic impacts and customer business relationships that may negatively and adversely impact our business , financial condition and or results of operations . the company also continues to experience volatility with customer orders within its twelve-week customer release window with some customers ( including tier 1 mirror suppliers ) revising orders at the last minute . due to significant uncertainties with global vehicle production volumes , it is an extremely difficult environment to forecast , and as a result , the company is not providing revenue estimates beyond the first quarter of 2014 at this time . the company also estimates that engineering , research and development expenses are currently expected to increase approximately 10 - 15 % in the first quarter of 2014 compared with the same period in 2013 , primarily due to staffing and benefit costs which continue to support growth and the development of new business , as well as personnel additions that were part of the homelink ® acquisition . in addition , the company estimates that selling , general and 20 administrative expenses are currently expected to increase approximately 20 - 25 % in the first quarter of 2014 compared with the same period in 2013 primarily due to incremental employment costs and amortization expense related to the homelink ® acquisition ( this estimate is based on stable foreign exchange rates ) . in light of on-going demand for our auto-dimming mirrors and electronics , the company currently anticipates that 2014 capital expenditures will be approximately $ 75 - $ 85 million , a majority of which will be production equipment purchases . 2014 capital expenditures are currently anticipated to be financed from current cash and cash equivalents on hand . market risk disclosure the company is subject to market risk exposures of varying correlations and volatilities , including foreign exchange rate risk , interest rate risk and equity price risk . volatile equity markets could negatively impact the company 's financial performance due to realized losses on the sale of equity investments and or recognized losses due to other-than-temporary impairment adjustments on available-for-sale securities ( mark-to-market adjustments ) . interest rate fluctuations on the company 's long term debt financing could negatively impact our financial performance due to increased borrowing costs . the company has some assets , liabilities and operations outside the united states , including a euro denominated account , which currently are not significant overall to the company as a whole . because the company sells its automotive mirrors throughout the world and automobile manufacturing is highly dependent on general economic conditions , it could be significantly affected by weak economic conditions in foreign markets that could reduce demand for its products . most of the company 's non-u.s. sales are invoiced and paid in u.s. dollars ; during 2013 , approximately 7 % of the company 's net sales were invoiced and paid in foreign currencies ( compared to 8 % for 2012 and 9 % for 2011 ) . the company currently expects that approximately 7 % of the company 's net sales in 2014 will be invoiced and paid in foreign currencies . the company does not currently engage in hedging activities . in 2013 , the company sold all holdings in its ' fixed-income investment portfolio in preparation for the homelink ® acquisition . in 2012 and prior years , the company managed its ' interest rate risk and default risk in its fixed-income investment portfolio by investing in shorter-term maturities and investment grade issues . the company 's fixed-income investments ' maturities at fair value ( 000,000 ) and average interest rates are as follows : replace_table_token_7_th most of the company 's equity investments are managed by a number of outside equity fund managers who invest primarily in large capitalization companies on the u.s. stock markets : the company does not have any significant off-balance sheet arrangements or commitments that have not been recorded in its consolidated financial statements .

"note 2 – acquisitions laker energy products ltd. on january 2 , 2020 , our subsidiary bwxt canada ltd. acquired laker energy products ltd. ( `` laker energy products `` ) for cad 23.3 million ( $ 17.8 million u.s. dollar equivalent ) . story_separator_special_tag statements we make in the following discussion , which express a belief , expectation or intention , as well as those that are not historical fact , are forward-looking statements that are subject to risks , uncertainties and assumptions . our actual results , performance or achievements , or industry results , could differ materially from those we express in the following discussion as a result of a variety of factors , including the risks and uncertainties we have referred to under the headings `` cautionary statement concerning forward-looking statements '' and `` risk factors '' in items 1 and 1a of part i of this report . general we are a leading supplier of nuclear components and fuel to the u.s. government ; provide technical , management and site services to support governments in the operation of complex facilities and environmental remediation activities ; supply precision manufactured components , nuclear fuel and services for the commercial nuclear power industry ; supply critical medical radioisotopes and radiopharmaceuticals ; and develop nuclear technologies for a variety of applications , including medical radioisotopes , advanced nuclear power sources and advanced nuclear reactors . in general , we operate in capital-intensive industries and rely on large contracts for a substantial amount of our revenues . we operate in three reportable segments : nuclear operations group , nuclear power group and nuclear services group . we are currently exploring growth strategies across our segments through strategic investments and acquisitions to expand and complement our existing businesses . we would expect to fund these opportunities with cash generated from operations or by raising additional capital through debt , equity or some combination thereof . outlook nuclear operations group we expect the backlog of our nuclear operations group segment of approximately $ 3,659 million at december 31 , 2020 to produce revenues of approximately $ 1,221 million in 2021 , not including any change orders or new contracts that may be awarded during the year . the revenues of our nuclear operations group segment are largely a function of defense spending by the u.s. government . as a supplier of major nuclear components for certain u.s. government programs , we are a significant participant in the defense industry and have not been negatively impacted by sequestration or federal budget reductions to date . we believe many of our programs are well-aligned with national defense and other strategic priorities as we supply high-end equipment for submarines and aircraft carriers for the u.s. navy . however , it is possible that reductions in federal government spending and sequestration could have an adverse impact on the operating results and cash flows of this segment in the future . we expect that orders for nuclear components will continue to be a significant part of backlog for the foreseeable future . in addition , the u.s. navy issued its fiscal year 2022 long-range shipbuilding plan in december 2020 , which maintains recommendations made in its fiscal year 2020 long-range shipbuilding plan ( released in september 2019 ) to increase the size of its fleet of ships to include additional submarines and aircraft carriers beyond the number disclosed prior to september 2019. while the new administration may make further changes with its fiscal year 2022 budget submission , we have made additional capital expenditures and investments in personnel to meet this anticipated growth in demand and we expect to continue making such expenditures and investments . nuclear power group we expect the backlog of our nuclear power group segment of approximately $ 726 million at december 31 , 2020 to produce revenues of approximately $ 307 million in 2021 , not including any change orders or new contracts that may be awarded during the year . the revenues in this segment primarily depend on the demand and competitiveness of nuclear energy . the activity of this segment depends on the timing of maintenance and refueling outages , the cyclical nature of capital expenditures and major refurbishment and plant life extension projects , as well as the demand for nuclear fuel and fuel handling equipment primarily in the canadian market , which could cause variability in our financial results . our acquisition of the mi business in july 2018 expanded our nuclear power group segment 's offerings to include medical radioisotope products . the mi business will be the platform from which we plan to launch our molybdenum-99 product line and a number of future radioisotope-based imaging , diagnostic and therapeutic products . 28 nuclear services group a significant portion of this segment 's operations is conducted through joint ventures , which typically earn fees , and we account for them following the equity method of accounting . see note 4 to our consolidated financial statements included in this report for financial information on our equity method investments . as a result , this segment reports minimal backlog and revenues . given our specialized capabilities of full life-cycle management of special materials , facilities and technologies , we believe our nuclear services group segment is well-positioned to participate in the continuing cleanup , operation and management of critical government-owned nuclear sites , laboratories and manufacturing complexes maintained by the doe , nasa and other federal agencies . however , it is possible that reductions in federal government spending and sequestration could have an adverse impact on the operating results and cash flows of this segment in the future . this segment also specializes in the development of advanced technologies . the nature , timing and duration of any related contracts are dependent on the demand and funding availability for such technologies . critical accounting policies and estimates our financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states ( `` gaap '' ) . story_separator_special_tag each year , we evaluate goodwill at each reporting unit to assess recoverability , and impairments , if any , are recognized in earnings . we perform a qualitative analysis when we believe that there is sufficient excess fair value over carrying value based on our most recent quantitative assessment , adjusted for relevant facts and circumstances that could affect fair value . deterioration in macroeconomic , industry and market conditions , cost factors , overall financial performance , share price decline or entity and reporting unit specific events could cause us to believe a qualitative test is no longer appropriate . when we determine that it is appropriate to test goodwill for impairment utilizing a quantitative test , we compare the fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying amount , including goodwill . we utilize both the income and market valuation approaches to provide inputs into the estimate of the fair value of our reporting units , which would be considered by market participants . under the income valuation approach , we employ a discounted cash flow model to estimate the fair value of each reporting unit . this model requires the use of significant estimates and assumptions regarding future revenues , costs , margins , capital expenditures , changes in working capital , terminal year growth rate and cost of capital . our cash flow models are based on our forecasted results for the applicable reporting units . actual results could differ materially from our projections . some assumptions , such as future revenues , costs and changes in working capital are company driven and could be affected by a loss of one or more significant contracts or customers , failure to control costs on certain contracts , a decline in u.s. government 30 funding or a decline in demand based on changing economic or regulatory conditions . changes in external market conditions may affect certain other assumptions , such as the cost of capital . market conditions can be volatile and are outside of our control . under the market valuation approach , we employ the guideline publicly traded company method , which indicates the fair value of the equity of each reporting unit by comparing it to publicly traded companies in similar lines of business . after identifying and selecting guideline companies , we analyze their business and financial profiles for relative similarity . factors such as size , growth , risk and profitability are analyzed and compared to each of our reporting units . assumptions include the selection of our peer companies and use of market multiples , which could deteriorate or increase based on the profitability of our competitors and performance of their stock , which is often dependent on the performance of the stock market and general economy as a whole . adverse changes in the assumptions utilized in our impairment test could cause a reduction or elimination of excess fair value over carrying value , resulting in potential recognition of impairment . if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value , no impairment charge is recorded . if the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value , an impairment charge is recorded to goodwill in the amount by which the carrying value exceeds fair value . we completed our annual review of goodwill for each of our reporting units for the year ended december 31 , 2020 , which indicated that we had no impairment of goodwill . the fair value of our reporting units was substantially in excess of carrying value . each year , we evaluate indefinite-lived intangible assets to assess recoverability , and impairments , if any , are recognized in earnings . we perform a qualitative assessment when testing indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment to determine whether events or circumstances that could affect the significant inputs used in determining fair value have occurred that indicate that it is more likely than not that the indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired . deterioration in macroeconomic , industry and market conditions , cost factors or overall financial performance could cause us to believe a qualitative test is no longer appropriate . when quantitative assessments are performed , we primarily utilize income-based valuation approaches . under the income-based valuation approach , we employ a relief from royalty method of valuation . this method requires significant assumptions , including assumed royalty rate , future revenues and cost of capital . assumptions related to operating performance , such as future revenues , could be affected by loss of a customer contract , a decline in u.s. government funding or a decline in demand based on changing economic or regulatory conditions . changes in external market conditions may affect certain other assumptions , such as the cost of capital . market conditions can be volatile and are outside of our control . adverse changes in these assumptions utilized within our indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment test could cause a reduction or elimination of excess fair value over carrying value , resulting in potential recognition of impairment . we have completed our annual review of our indefinite-lived intangible assets for the year ended december 31 , 2020 , which indicated that we had no impairment . the fair value of our indefinite-lived intangible assets was substantially in excess of carrying value . asset retirement obligations and environmental cleanup costs . we accrue for future decommissioning of our nuclear facilities that will permit the release of these facilities to unrestricted use at the end of each facility 's service life , which is a requirement of our licenses from the nrc and the cnsc . in accordance with the fasb topic asset retirement and environmental obligations , we record the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period in which it is incurred . in estimating fair value , we use present value of cash flows expected to be incurred in settling our obligations .
","consolidated results of operations consolidated revenues increased 12.1 % , or $ 228.6 million , to $ 2,123.5 million in the year ended december 31 , 2020 compared to $ 1,894.9 million for the corresponding period of 2019 , due to increases in revenues from our nuclear operations group , nuclear power group and nuclear services group segments totaling $ 217.7 million , $ 18.6 million and $ 5.2 million , respectively . consolidated operating income increased $ 33.0 million to $ 358.6 million in the year ended december 31 , 2020 compared to $ 325.5 million for the corresponding period of 2019. operating income in our nuclear operations group , nuclear services group and other segments increased by $ 27.7 million , $ 12.2 million and $ 0.8 million , respectively . these increases were partially offset by lower operating income in our nuclear power group segment of $ 1.8 million and higher unallocated corporate expenses of $ 5.9 million when compared to the prior year . nuclear operations group replace_table_token_7_th revenues increased by 15.2 % , or $ 217.7 million , to $ 1,646.3 million in the year ended december 31 , 2020 compared to $ 1,428.6 million for the corresponding period of 2019 as we continue to expand production related to the columbia-class nuclear propulsion system . the increase comprised additional volume in the manufacture of nuclear components for u.s. government programs and the timing of the procurement of certain long-lead materials when compared to the prior year . we also experienced a volume increase in our naval nuclear fuel and downblending operations . 33 operating income increased $ 27.7 million to $ 326.0 million in the year ended december 31 , 2020 compared to $ 298.3 million for the corresponding period of 2019. the increase was due to the operating income impact of the changes in revenues noted above .

"no amounts were reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income in fiscal story_separator_special_tag the following should be read in conjunction with part i , including the matters set forth in the “ risk factors ” section of this report , and our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this report . overview in march 2020 , the outbreak of covid-19 caused by a novel strain of the coronavirus was recognized as a pandemic by the world health organization , and the outbreak has become increasingly widespread in the united states ( including florida in which we generated approximately 54 % of our revenue in 2019 and 2020 ) , and other countries in which we operate . as a result , beginning in march 2020 , we had temporarily closed certain departments or locations based on guidance from local government or health officials . as of today , many of our stores are fully or partially operational . we are following guidelines to ensure we are safely operating as recommended . where possible , we are offering private personal showings as well as virtual appointments . our digital platform is serving as an effective solution in this environment with robust online activity . our experienced teams continue to engage with customers virtually and in our stores to help customers select their boats , and obtain appropriate services . we are the largest recreational boat and yacht retailer in the united states with fiscal 2020 revenue above $ 1.5 billion . through our current 77 retail locations in 21 states ( as of the filing of this annual report on form 10-k ) , we sell new and used recreational boats and related marine products , including engines , trailers , parts , and accessories . we also arrange related boat financing , insurance , and extended service contracts ; provide boat repair and maintenance services ; offer yacht and boat brokerage sales ; yacht charter services ; and , where available , offer slip and storage accommodations , as well as the charter of power yachts in the british virgin islands . we also own fraser yachts group and northrop & johnson , leading superyacht brokerage and luxury yacht services companies with operations in multiple countries , and skipperbud 's , one of the largest sales , brokerage , service and marina/storage groups in the united states . marinemax was incorporated in january 1998 ( and reincorporated in florida in march 2015 ) . we commenced operations with the acquisition of five independent recreational boat dealers on march 1 , 1998. since the initial acquisitions in march 1998 , we have , as of the filing of this annual report on form 10-k , acquired 30 recreational boat dealers , four boat brokerage operations , and two full-service yacht repair facilities . as a part of our acquisition strategy , we frequently engage in discussions with various recreational boat dealers regarding their potential acquisition by us . potential acquisition discussions frequently take place over a long period of time and involve difficult business integration and other issues , including , in some cases , management succession and related matters . as a result of these and other factors , a number of potential acquisitions that from time to time appear likely to occur do not result in binding legal agreements and are not consummated . we completed three acquisitions in the fiscal year ended september 30 , 2018 , two acquisitions in the fiscal year ended september 30 , 2019 , and two acquisitions in the fiscal year ending september 30 , 2020. general economic conditions and consumer spending patterns can negatively impact our operating results . unfavorable local , regional , national or global economic developments or uncertainties regarding future economic prospects could reduce consumer spending in the markets we serve and adversely affect our business . economic conditions in areas in which we operate dealerships , particularly florida in which we generated approximately 51 % , 54 % and 54 % of our revenue during fiscal 2018 , 2019 , and 2020 , respectively , can have a major impact on our operations . local influences , such as corporate downsizing , military base closings , and inclement weather such as hurricanes and other storms , environmental conditions , and specific events , such as the bp oil spill in the gulf of mexico in 2010 , also could adversely affect , and in certain instances have adversely affected , our operations in certain markets . in an economic downturn , consumer discretionary spending levels generally decline , at times resulting in disproportionately large reductions in the sale of luxury goods . consumer spending on luxury goods also may decline as a result of lower consumer confidence levels , even if prevailing economic conditions are favorable . as a result , an economic downturn could impact us more than certain of our competitors due to our strategic focus on a higher end of our market . although we have expanded our operations during periods of stagnant or modestly declining industry trends , the cyclical nature of the recreational boating industry or the lack of industry growth may adversely affect our business , financial condition , and results of operations . any period of adverse economic conditions or low consumer confidence is likely to have a negative effect on our business . historically , in periods of lower consumer spending and depressed economic conditions , we have , among other things , substantially reduced our acquisition program , delayed new store openings , reduced our inventory purchases , engaged in inventory reduction efforts , closed a number of our retail locations , reduced our headcount , and amended and replaced our credit facility . 34 although past economic conditions have adversely affected our operating results , we believe we have capitalized on our core strengths to substantially outperform the industry , resulting in market share gains . our ability to capture such market share supports the alignment of our retailing strategies with the desires of consumers . story_separator_special_tag total contract liabilities of approximately $ 24.3 million recorded as of september 30 , 2019 were recognized in revenue during the fiscal year ended september 30 , 2020. contract a ssets , recorded in p repaid expenses and other current assets , totaled approximately $ 2.5 million and $ 2.6 million as of september 30 , 2019 and september 30 , 2020 , respectively . vendor consideration received we account for consideration received from our vendors in accordance with asu 2014-09 , “ revenue from contracts with customers ( topic 606 ) ” . asc 606 requires us to classify interest assistance received from manufacturers as a reduction of inventory cost and related cost of sales as opposed to netting the assistance against our interest expense incurred with our lenders . pursuant to asc 606 , amounts received by us under our co-op assistance programs from our manufacturers are netted against related advertising expenses . our consideration received from our vendors contains uncertainties because the calculation requires management to make assumptions and to apply judgment regarding a number of factors , including our ability to collect amounts due from vendors and the ability to meet certain criteria stipulated by our vendors . we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to calculate our vendor considerations which would result in a material effect on our operating results . inventories inventory costs consist of the amount paid to acquire inventory , net of vendor consideration and purchase discounts , the cost of equipment added , reconditioning costs , and transportation costs relating to acquiring inventory for sale . we state new and used boat , motor , and trailer inventories at the lower of cost , determined on a specific-identification basis , or net realizable value . we state parts and accessories at the lower of cost , determined on an average cost basis , or net realizable value . we utilize our historical experience , the aging of the inventories , and our consideration of current market trends as the basis for determining a lower of cost or net realizable value valuation allowance . our lower of cost or net realizable value valuation allowance contains uncertainties because the calculation requires management to make assumptions and to apply judgment regarding the amount at which the inventory will ultimately be sold which considers forecasted market trends , model changes , and new product introductions . we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to calculate our lower of cost or net realizable value valuation allowance which would result in a material effect on our operating results . as of september 30 , 2019 and september 30 , 2020 , our lower of cost or net realizable value valuation allowance for new and used boat , motor , and trailer inventories was $ 2.2 million and $ 2.4 million , respectively . if events occur and market conditions change , causing the fair value to fall below carrying value , the lower of cost or net realizable value valuation allowance could increase . goodwill we account for goodwill in accordance with fasb accounting standards codification 350 , “ intangibles — goodwill and other ” ( “ asc 350 ” ) , which provides that the excess of cost over net assets of businesses acquired is recorded as goodwill . in july 2020 , we purchased northrop & johnson , a leading superyacht brokerage and services company . in march 2020 , we purchased boatyard , a digital platform with an expansive range of on-demand services to streamline the boating experience by qualified service providers from a smartphone . in july 2019 , we purchased fraser yachts group , a leading superyacht brokerage and largest luxury yacht services company . in april 2019 , we purchased sail & ski center , a privately owned boat dealer located in texas . goodwill and other intangible assets increased , due to acquisitions , by $ 37.0 million and $ 20.2 million , for the fiscal years ended september 30 , 2019 and 2020 , respectively . these acquisitions have resulted in the recording of goodwill for tax purposes of $ 10.5 million and $ 16.8 million , for the fiscal years ended september 30 , 2019 and 2020 , respectively . in total , current and previous acquisitions have resulted in the recording of $ 84.3 million in goodwill and other intangible assets as of september 30 , 2020. in accordance with asc 350 , we review goodwill for impairment at least annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable . our annual impairment test is performed during the fourth fiscal quarter . if the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its fair value we would recognize an impairment loss in accordance with asc 350. as of september 30 , 2020 , and based upon our most recent analysis , we determined through our qualitative assessment that it is not “ more likely than not ” that the fair values of our reporting units are less than their carrying values . as a result , we were not required to perform a quantitative goodwill impairment test . the qualitative assessment requires us to make judgments and assumptions regarding macroeconomic and industry conditions , our financial performance , and other factors . we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a change in the judgments and assumptions used in our qualitative assessment which would result in a material effect on our operating results .
","results of operations the following table sets forth certain financial data as a percentage of revenue for the periods indicated : replace_table_token_9_th fiscal year ended september 30 , 2020 , compared with fiscal year ended september 30 , 2019 revenue . revenue increased $ 272.6 million , or 22.0 % , to approximately $ 1.510 billion for the fiscal year ended september 30 , 2020 from $ 1.237 billion for the fiscal year ended september 30 , 2019. of this increase , $ 291.0 million was attributable to a 25 % increase in comparable-store sales and an approximate $ 18.4 million net decrease related to stores opened or closed that were not eligible for inclusion in the comparable-store base . the increase in our comparable-store sales was primarily due to incremental increases in new and used boat sales and incremental increases in storage services , finance and insurance products , and brokerage sales . improving industry conditions in the seasonal summer months contributed to our growth . gross profit . gross profit increased $ 75.9 million , or 23.5 % , to $ 398.7 million for the fiscal year ended september 30 , 2020 from $ 322.8 million for the fiscal year ended september 30 , 2019. gross profit as a percentage of revenue increased to 26.4 % for the fiscal year ended september 30 , 2020 from 26.1 % for the fiscal year ended september 30 , 2019. the increase in gross profit as a percentage of revenue was primarily the result of increases to our higher margins businesses and from the acquisition of the fraser yachts group and northrop & johnson because the sales generated by fraser and northrop & johnson relating to their services tend to be of higher margins relative to our overall business . the increase in gross profit dollars was primarily attributable to the increase in our gross margins and increased boat sales . selling , general and administrative expenses .

"amount , and dividing by that period 's total average assets . a lower ratio indicates a higher degree of efficiency . ( 4 ) the efficiency ratio is calculated by dividing total non-interest expense by tax-equivalent net revenues ( less securities gains or losses ) . a lower ratio indicates more efficient revenue generation . please refer to the consolidated results of operations section later in this discussion for an analysis of the company 's operations for the past three years . non-gaap financial measures/ratios the accounting and reporting policies of wintrust conform to generally accepted accounting principles ( gaap ) in the united states and prevailing practices in the banking industry . however , certain non-gaap performance measures and ratios are used by management to evaluate and measure the company 's performance . these include taxable-equivalent net interest income ( including its individual components ) , net interest margin ( including its individual components ) , the efficiency ratio , tangible common equity ratio , tangible common book value per share and pre-tax adjusted earnings . management believes that these measures and ratios provide users of the company 's financial information a more meaningful view of the performance of the interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities and of the company 's operating efficiency . other financial holding companies may define or calculate these measures and ratios differently . management reviews yields on certain asset categories and the net interest margin of the company and its banking subsidiaries on a fully taxable-equivalent ( fte ) basis . in this non-gaap presentation , net interest income is adjusted to reflect tax-exempt interest income on an equivalent before-tax basis . this measure ensures comparability of net interest income arising from both taxable and tax-exempt sources . net interest income on a fte basis is also used in the calculation of the company 's efficiency ratio . the efficiency ratio , which is calculated by dividing non-interest expense by total taxable-equivalent net revenue ( less securities gains or losses ) , measures how much it costs to produce one dollar of revenue . securities gains or losses are excluded from this calculation to better match revenue from daily operations to operational expenses . management considers the tangible common equity ratio and tangible book value per common share as useful measurements of the

traditional community banking services , primarily in the chicago metropolitan area and southeastern wisconsin , and operates other financing businesses on a national basis through several non-bank subsidiaries . additionally , wintrust offers a full array of wealth management services primarily to customers in our market area . 2011 highlights the company recorded net income of $ 77.6 million for the year of 2011 compared to $ 63.3 million and $ 73.1 million for the years of 2010 and 2009 , respectively . the results for 2011 demonstrate continued operating strengths as credit related costs remain at levels similar to previous years , loans outstanding increased , demand deposits related to this loan growth increased , and the beneficial shift in our deposit mix away from single-product cd customers continued . the company also continues to take advantage of the opportunities that have resulted from distressed credit markets  specifically , a dislocation of assets , banks and people in the overall market . for more information , see overview and strategyacquisition transactions. the company increased its loan portfolio , excluding covered loans , from $ 9.6 billion at december 31 , 2010 to $ 10.5 billion at december 31 , 2011. this increase was primarily a result of the company 's commercial banking initiative , loans obtained in the acquisition of elgin state bank , as well as growth in the premium finance receivables  life insurance portfolio . the company continues to make new loans , including in the commercial and commercial real estate sector , where opportunities that meet our underwriting standards exist . the withdrawal of many banks in our area from active lending combined with our strong local relationships has presented us with opportunities to make new loans to well qualified borrowers who have been displaced from other institutions . for more information regarding changes in the company 's loan portfolio , see analysis of financial condition  interest earning assets and note 4 loans of the financial statements presented under item 1 of this report . management considers the maintenance of adequate liquidity to be important to the management of risk . accordingly , during 2011 , the company continued its practice of maintaining appropriate funding capacity to provide the company with adequate liquidity for its ongoing operations . in this regard , the company benefited from its strong deposit base , a liquid short-term investment portfolio and its access to funding from a variety of external funding sources . at december 31 , 2011 , the company had overnight liquid funds and interest-bearing deposits with banks of $ 919.0 million compared to $ 1.0 billion at december 31 , 2010. the company experienced a 32 % decline in mortgage origination volumes in 2011 compared to the previous year . story_separator_special_tag the commercial real estate loan portfolio was comprised of $ 414.2 million related to land , residential and commercial construction , $ 554.4 million related to office buildings loans , $ 536.7 million related to retail loans , $ 555.8 million related to industrial use loans , $ 314.6 million related to multi-family loans and $ 1.1 billion related to mixed use and other use types . in analyzing the commercial real estate market , the company does not rely upon the assessment of broad market statistical data , in large part because the company 's market area is diverse and covers many communities , each of which is impacted differently by economic forces affecting the company 's general market area . as such , the extent of the decline in real estate valuations can vary meaningfully among the different types of commercial and other real estate loans made by the company . the company uses its multi-chartered structure and local management knowledge to analyze and manage the local market conditions at each of its banks . despite these efforts , as of december 31 , 2011 , the company had approximately $ 66.5 million of non-performing commercial real estate loans representing approximately 2 % of the total commercial real estate loan portfolio . $ 35.7 million , or 54 % , of the total non-performing commercial real estate loan portfolio related to the land , residential and commercial construction sector which remains under stress due to the significant oversupply of new homes in certain portions of our market area . total non-performing loans ( loans on non-accrual status and loans more than 90 days past due and still accruing interest ) , excluding covered loans , were $ 120.1 million ( of which $ 66.5 million , or 55 % , was related to commercial real estate ) at december 31 , 2011 , a decrease of $ 21.9 million compared to december 31 , 2010. non-performing loans decreased as a result of the company 's efforts to resolve problem loans through liquidation . the company 's other real estate owned , excluding covered other real estate owned , increased by $ 15.3 million , to $ 86.5 million during 2011 , from $ 71.2 million at december 31 , 2010. the increase in other real estate owned included $ 7.4 million of properties acquired in the acquisition of elgin state bank . the $ 86.5 million of other real estate owned as of december 31 , 2011 was comprised of $ 19.9 million of residential real estate development property , $ 59.3 million of commercial real estate property and $ 7.3 million of residential real estate property . during 2011 , management continued its efforts to aggressively resolve problem loans through liquidation , rather than retention , of loans or real estate acquired as collateral through the foreclosure process . this strategic effort was implemented in 2009. management believes that some financial institutions have taken a longer term view of problem loan situations , hoping to realize higher values on acquired collateral through extended marketing efforts or an improvement in market conditions . management believed that the distressed macro-economic conditions would continue to exist in 2011 and that the banking industry 's continued elevated levels in non-performing loans would lead to many properties being sold by financial institutions , thus saturating the market and possibly driving fair values of non-performing loans and foreclosed collateral further downwards . accordingly , since 2009 the company has attempted to liquidate as many non-performing loans and assets as possible . management believes these actions will serve the company well in the future by providing some protection for the company from further valuation deterioration and permitting management to spend less time on resolution of problem loans and more time on growing the company 's core business and the evaluation of other opportunities presented by this volatile economic environment . the company continues to take advantage of the opportunities that many times result from distressed credit markets  specifically , a dislocation of assets , banks and people in the overall market . the level of loans past due 30 days or more and still accruing interest , excluding covered loans , totaled $ 147.9 million as of december 31 , 2011 , increasing $ 1.0 million compared to the balance of $ 146.9 million as of december 31 , 2010. management is very cognizant of the volatility in and the fragile nature of the national and local economic conditions and that some borrowers can 37 experience severe difficulties and default suddenly even if they have never previously been delinquent in loan payments . accordingly , management believes that the current economic conditions will continue to apply stress to the quality of the company 's loan portfolio . accordingly , management plans to continue to direct significant attention toward the prompt identification , management and resolution of problem loans . additionally in 2011 , the company restructured certain loans by providing economic concessions to borrowers to better align the terms of their loans with their current ability to pay . at december 31 , 2011 , approximately $ 130.5 million in loans had terms modified , with $ 119.9 million of these modified loans in accruing status . these actions helped financially stressed borrowers maintain their homes or businesses and kept these loans in an accruing status for the company . the company considers restructuring loans when it appears that both the borrower and the company can benefit and preserve a solid and sustainable relationship . see note 5  allowance for loan losses , allowance for losses on lending-related commitments and impaired loans for additional discussion of restructured loans . an acceleration or continuation of real estate valuation and macroeconomic deterioration could result in higher default levels , a significant increase in foreclosure activity , and a material decline in the value of the company 's assets .
","operating segment results as described in note 25 to the consolidated financial statements , the company 's operations consist of three primary segments : community banking , specialty finance and wealth management . the company 's profitability is primarily dependent on the net interest income , provision for credit losses , non-interest income and operating expenses of its community banking segment . the net interest income of the community banking segment includes interest income and related interest costs from portfolio loans that 53 were purchased from the specialty finance segment . for purposes of internal segment profitability analysis , management reviews the results of its specialty finance segment as if all loans originated and sold to the community banking segment were retained within that segment 's operations . similarly , for purposes of analyzing the contribution from the wealth management segment , management allocates a portion of the net interest income earned by the community banking segment on deposit balances of customers of the wealth management segment to the wealth management segment . ( see wealth management deposits discussion in the deposits and other funding sources section of this report for more information on these deposits . ) the community banking segment 's net interest income for the year ended december 31 , 2011 totaled $ 428.1 million as compared to $ 386.6 million for the same period in 2010 , an increase of $ 41.5 million , or 11 % , whereas the segment 's net interest income in 2010 compared to 2009 increased $ 86.0 million or 29 % . the increases in 2011 compared to 2010 as well as 2010 compared to 2009 were primarily attributable to earning assets acquired in fdic-assisted bank acquisitions in each period and the ability to gather interest-bearing deposits at more reasonable rates .

"fair value is based on quoted secondary market pricing for loan portfolios with similar 89 characteristics and includes consideration of deferred fees ( costs ) . net unrealized losses or net unrealized gains on loans carried at fair value , are recognized in a valuation allowance by charges to income . the company retains servicing on loans that are sold and initially recognizes an asset for mortgage loan servicing rights based on the fair story_separator_special_tag overview our business strategy is to operate as a well-capitalized and profitable financial institution dedicated to providing exceptional personal service to our customers . since being organized in 1938 , we grew to become , at the time of our initial public offering of stock in april 2007 , the nation 's largest mutually-owned savings and loan association based on total assets . we credit our success to our continued emphasis on our primary values : “ love , trust , respect , and a commitment to excellence , along with having fun. ” our values are reflected in the design and pricing of our loan and deposit products , as described below . our values are further reflected in a long-term revitalization program encompassing the three-mile corridor of the broadway-slavic village neighborhood in cleveland , ohio where our main office was established and continues to be located and the educational programs we have established and or supported . we intend to continue to adhere to our primary values and to support our customers and the communities in which we operate . management believes that the following matters are those most critical to our success : ( 1 ) controlling our interest rate risk exposure ; ( 2 ) monitoring and limiting our credit risk ; ( 3 ) maintaining access to adequate liquidity and diverse funding sources ; and ( 4 ) monitoring and controlling operating expenses . controlling our interest rate risk exposure . although the significant housing and credit quality issues that arose in connection with the 2008 financial crisis had a distinctly negative effect on our operating results and , as described below , that experience made a lasting impression on our risk awareness , historically our greatest risk has been our exposure to changes in interest rates . when we hold long-term , fixed-rate assets , funded by liabilities with shorter re-pricing characteristics , we are exposed to potentially adverse impacts from changing interest rates , and most notably rising interest rates . generally , and particularly over extended periods of time that encompass full economic cycles , interest rates associated with longer-term assets , like fixed-rate mortgages , have been higher than interest rates associated with shorter-term funding sources , like deposits . this difference has been an important component of our net interest income and is fundamental to our operations . we manage the risk of holding longer-term , fixed-rate mortgage assets primarily by maintaining the levels of regulatory capital required to be well capitalized , by promoting adjustable-rate loans and shorter-term , fixed-rate loans , by marketing home equity lines of credit , which carry an adjustable rate of interest indexed to the prime rate and by opportunistically extending the duration of our funding sources . levels of regulatory capital at september 30 , 2018 , the company 's tier 1 ( leverage ) capital totaled $ 1.71 billion , or 12.25 % of net average assets and 22.39 % of risk-weighted assets , while the association 's tier 1 ( leverage ) capital totaled $ 1.52 billion , or 10.87 % of net average assets and 19.91 % of risk-weighted assets . each of these measures was more than twice the requirements currently in effect for designation as “ well capitalized ” under regulatory prompt corrective action provisions , which set minimum levels of 5.00 % of net average assets and 8.00 % of risk-weighted assets . refer to the liquidity and capital resources section of this item 7 for additional discussion regarding regulatory capital requirements . promotion of adjustable-rate loans and shorter-term , fixed-rate loans we market an adjustable-rate mortgage loan that provides us with improved interest rate risk characteristics when compared to a 30-year , fixed-rate mortgage loan . our “ smart rate ” adjustable rate mortgage offers borrowers an interest rate lower than that of a 30-year , fixed-rate loan . the interest rate in the smart rate mortgage is locked for three or five years then resets annually . the smart rate mortgage contains a feature to re-lock the rate an unlimited number of times at our then-current interest rate and fee schedule , for another three or five years ( which must be the same as the original lock period ) without having to complete a full refinance transaction . re-lock eligibility is subject to a satisfactory payment performance history by the borrower ( current at the time of re-lock , and no foreclosures or bankruptcies since the smart rate application was taken ) . in addition to a satisfactory payment history , re-lock eligibility requires that the property continues to be the borrower 's primary residence . the loan term can not be extended in connection with a re-lock nor can new funds be advanced . all interest rate caps and floors remain as originated . we also feature a ten-year , fully amortizing fixed-rate first mortgage loan in our product promotions . the ten-year , fixed-rate loan has a less severe interest rate risk profile when compared to loans with fixed-rate terms of 15 to 30 years and helps us to more effectively manage our interest rate risk exposure , yet provides our borrowers with the certainty of a fixed interest rate throughout the life of the obligation . 56 the following tables set forth our first mortgage loan production and balances segregated by loan structure at origination . replace_table_token_36_th replace_table_token_37_th the following table sets forth the balances as of september 30 , 2018 for all arm loans segregated by the next scheduled interest rate reset date . story_separator_special_tag at september 30 , 2018 , the recorded investment in non-accrual status loans included $ 29.4 million of performing loans in chapter 7 bankruptcy status , of which $ 28.1 million were also reported as tdrs . in response to the unfavorable regional and macro-economic environment that arose beginning in 2008 , and in an effort to limit our credit risk exposure and improve the credit performance of new customers , we tightened our credit eligibility criteria in evaluating a borrower 's ability to successfully fulfill his or her repayment obligation and we revised the design of many of our loan products to require higher borrower down-payments , limited the products available for condominiums , eliminated certain product features ( such as interest-only adjustable-rate loans and loans above certain ltv ratios ) , and we suspended home equity lending products with the exception of bridge loans between 2010 and 2012. the delinquency level related to loan originations prior to 2009 , compared to originations in 2009 and after , reflect the higher credit standards to which we have subjected all new originations . as of september 30 , 2018 , loans originated prior to 2009 had a balance of $ 1.06 billion , of which $ 33.1 million , or 3.1 % , were delinquent , while loans originated in 2009 and after had a balance of $ 11.85 billion , of which $ 8.4 million , or 0.1 % , were delinquent . one aspect of our credit risk concern relates to high concentrations of our loans that are secured by residential real estate in specific states , particularly ohio and florida , in light of the difficulties that arose in connection with the 2008 housing crisis with respect to the real estate markets in those two states . at september 30 , 2018 , approximately 55.6 % and 16.0 % of the combined total of our residential core and construction loans held for investment and approximately 35.9 % and 20.3 % of our home equity loans and lines of credit were secured by properties in ohio and florida , respectively . in an effort to moderate the 58 concentration of our credit risk exposure in individual states , particularly ohio and florida , we have utilized direct mail marketing , our internet site and our customer service call center to extend our lending activities to other attractive geographic locations . currently , in addition to ohio and florida , we are actively lending in 19 other states and the district of columbia , and as a result of that activity , the concentration ratios of the combined total of our residential , core and construction loans held for investment in ohio and florida have trended downward from their september 30 , 2010 levels when the concentrations were 79.1 % in ohio and 19.0 % in florida . of the total first mortgage originations for the years ended september 30 , 2018 and 2017 , 28.4 % and 34.7 % , respectively , are secured by properties in states other than ohio or florida . our residential home today loans are another area of credit risk concern . although we no longer originate loans under this program and the principal balance in these loans had declined to $ 94.9 million at september 30 , 2018 and constituted only 0.7 % of our total “ held for investment ” loan portfolio balance , they comprised 18.6 % and 20.2 % of our 90 days or greater delinquencies and our total delinquencies , respectively , at that date . at september 30 , 2018 , approximately 95.4 % and 4.4 % of our residential home today loans were secured by properties in ohio and florida , respectively . at september 30 , 2018 , the percentages of those loans delinquent 30 days or more in ohio and florida were 9.1 % and 3.1 % , respectively . the disparity between the portfolio composition ratio and delinquency composition ratio reflects the nature of the home today loans . we do not offer , and have not offered , loan products frequently considered to be designed to target sub-prime borrowers containing features such as higher fees or higher rates , negative amortization , or low initial payment features with adjustable interest rates . our home today loans , the majority of which were entered into with borrowers that had credit profiles that would not have otherwise qualified for our loan products due to deficient credit scores , generally contained the same features as loans offered to our core borrowers . the overriding objective of our home today lending , just as it is with our core lending , was the creation of successful homeowners . we have attempted to manage our home today credit risk by requiring that borrowers attend pre- and post-borrowing financial management education and counseling and that the borrowers be referred to us by a sponsoring organization with which we have partnered . further , to manage the credit aspect of these loans , inasmuch as the majority of these buyers did not have sufficient funds for required down payments , many loans included private mortgage insurance . at september 30 , 2018 , 17.8 % of home today loans included private mortgage insurance coverage . from a peak recorded investment of $ 306.6 million at december 31 , 2007 , the total recorded investment of the home today portfolio has declined to $ 94.7 million at september 30 , 2018 . since the vast majority of home today loans were originated prior to march 2009 and we are no longer originating loans under our home today program , the home today portfolio will continue to decline in balance due to contractual amortization . to supplant the home today product and to continue to meet the credit needs of our customers and the communities that we serve , we have offered fannie mae eligible , homeready loans since fiscal 2016. these loans are originated in accordance with fannie mae 's underwriting standards .
","overview for further discussion . based on our evaluation , we recorded a credit for loan losses of $ 17.0 million for the fiscal year ended september 30 , 2017 and a credit of $ 8.0 million for the fiscal year ended september 30 , 2016. the current credit for loan losses reflects reduced levels of loan delinquencies and net charge-offs , but we continue our awareness of the relative values of residential properties in comparison to their cyclical peaks as well as the uncertainty that persists in the current economic environment , which continues to challenge many of our loan customers . as delinquencies in the portfolio have been resolved through pay-off , short sale or foreclosure , or management determines the collateral is not sufficient to satisfy the loan , uncollected balances have been charged against the allowance for loan losses previously provided . the level of net charge-offs decreased during fiscal year 2017 to $ 4.2 million of net recoveries as compared to $ 1.8 million of net charge-offs during the fiscal year ended september 30 , 2016. net recoveries combined with the $ 17.0 million credit for loan losses recorded for the 2017 fiscal year resulted in a decrease in the balance of the allowance for loan losses . net charge-offs of $ 1.8 million and a credit for loan losses of $ 8.0 million were recorded for the fiscal year ended september 30 , 2016. the allowance for loan losses was $ 48.9 million , or 0.39 % of the total recorded investment in loans receivable , at september 30 , 2017 , compared to $ 61.8 million , or 0.52 % of the total recorded investment in loans receivable , at september 30 , 2016. balances of recorded investments are net of deferred fees/expenses and any applicable loans-in-process .

"deposits : we offer a full range of deposit products and services including checking , savings and time deposits , cash management , and electronic banking services . we also maintain a broad branch and atm network in the state of hawaii . the interest paid on such deposits has a significant impact on our interest expense , an important factor in determining our earnings . in addition , fees and service charges on deposit accounts contribute to our revenues . additionally , we offer wealth management products and services , such as non-deposit investment products , annuities , insurance , investment management , asset custody and general consultation and planning services . executive overview in 2020 , we believe we delivered strong financial performance for the company despite the pandemic environment . we recorded net income of $ 37.3 million , or $ 1.32 per diluted common share in 2020 , compared to $ 58.3 million , or $ 2.03 per diluted common share in 2019. we recorded pre-tax pre-provision income of $ 88.2 million in 2020 , compared to $ 84.2 million in 2019. we recorded return on average assets ( `` roa '' ) and return on average shareholders ' equity ( `` roe '' ) ratios of 0.58 % and 6.85 % , respectively , in 2020 , compared to roa and roe ratios of 0.99 % and 11.36 % , respectively , in 2019. asset quality remains strong as our nonperforming assets totaled $ 6.2 million , or 0.09 % of total assets at december 31 , 2020 , compared to $ 1.7 million , or 0.03 % of total assets at december 31 , 2019. we realized strong loan growth of $ 514.6 million , or 11.6 % ( or growth of $ 98.2 million or 2.2 % excluding small business administration ( `` sba '' ) paycheck protection program ( `` ppp '' ) loans ) , as well as strong core deposit growth of $ 786.9 million , or 18.5 % in 2020. we completed a $ 55 million private placement of ten-year fixed-to-floating rate subordinated notes which strengthened our capital position . our capital position and consistent profitability allowed us to increase our regular cash dividends paid from $ 0.90 per share in 2019 to $ 0.92 per share in 2020. rise2020 commencing in the second quarter of 2019 , the company launched rise2020 , a multifaceted initiative intended to enhance customer experience , drive stronger long-term growth and profitability , improve shareholder returns and lower our efficiency ratio . rise2020 includes initiatives in the following key areas of opportunity : digital banking , revenue enhancements , branch transformation and operational excellence . rise2020 is intended to provide central pacific bank with premier products and services in several strategic areas . during 2019 , the outsourcing of the company 's residential mortgage loan servicing , the launch of its new website under the cpb.bank domain name and the implementation of its end-to-end commercial loan origination system was completed . during the first quarter of 2020 , the company opened its concept branch , providing its customers a glimpse into the future of central pacific bank . after significant development , the company 's new online and 38 mobile banking platforms for its retail customers launched in august 2020. the rollout of newly upgrade atms was completed in the fourth quarter of 2020. despite several challenges resulting from the impact of the covid-19 pandemic , the company completed its rise2020 initiative culminating with the grand opening of the fully renovated central pacific plaza headquarters building and flagship main branch , and the launch of a new brand design in early january 2021. basis of presentation management 's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements under `` part ii , item 8. financial statements and supplementary data . '' covid-19 pandemic the ongoing novel coronavirus disease ( `` covid-19 '' ) pandemic has caused significant disruption in the local , national and global economies and financial markets . the pandemic has resulted in temporary closures of many businesses and the institution of social distancing and sheltering in place requirements in many states and communities . continuation and further spread of covid-19 could cause additional quarantines , shutdowns , reductions in business activity and financial transactions , labor shortages , supply chain interruptions and overall economic and financial market instability . in response to the anticipated economic effects of covid-19 , the board of governors of the federal reserve system ( the `` frb '' ) has taken a number of actions that have significantly affected the financial markets in the united states , including actions intended to result in substantial decreases in market interest rates . on march 3 , 2020 , the 10-year treasury yield fell below 1.00 % for the first time , and the frb reduced the target federal funds range by 50 basis points to 1.00 % to 1.25 % . on march 15 , 2020 , the frb further reduced the target federal funds range by 100 basis points to 0 % to 0.25 % and announced a $ 700 billion quantitative easing program in response to the expected economic downturn caused by covid-19 . on march 22 , 2020 , the frb announced that it would continue its quantitative easing program in amounts necessary to support the smooth functioning of markets for treasury securities and agency mbs . we expect that these reductions in interest rates , among other actions of the frb and the federal government generally , especially if prolonged , could adversely affect our net interest income , margins and profitability . story_separator_special_tag loans on active payment forbearance or deferrals granted to borrowers impacted by the covid-19 pandemic declined significantly from $ 567.9 million or , 11.3 % of the total loan portfolio ( or 12.7 % excluding ppp loans ) as of june 30 , 2020 , to $ 120.2 million , or 2.4 % of the total loan portfolio ( or 2.6 % excluding ppp loans ) , as of december 31 , 2020 as many borrowers resumed payments . the following table sets forth all loans to borrowers impacted by covid-19 on active payment forbearance or deferral and the percentage of loans on active payment forbearance or deferral to total loans and total loans , excluding ppp loans , as of december 31 , 2020 : replace_table_token_6_th the company 's interest income could also be reduced due to covid-19 . interest and fees still accrue on amounts that are deemed collectible during the deferral period , however , should the company later determine that collection of payments is not expected and eventual credit losses on these deferred payments emerge , accrued and unpaid interest income and fees will need to be reversed . in such a scenario , interest income in future periods could be negatively impacted . during the third quarter of 2020 , the company recorded a reserve on the accrued interest receivable for loans on active forbearance or deferral totaling $ 0.2 million . this reserve balance remained unchanged during the fourth quarter of 2020. the company may need to increase this reserve or reverse accrued interest receivable which may negatively impact interest income in future periods if it is determined that the accrued interest receivable is uncollectible . 40 the company 's aggregate fee income could be reduced due to covid-19 . the company has experienced a decline in transactional activity due to covid-19 . in addition , to support our customers during this difficult time , the company temporarily waived non-cpb atm fees and early withdrawal fees on our time deposits and granted temporary increases on debit card and mobile deposit transaction limits throughout the second quarter of 2020. beginning july 1 , 2020 , we reinstated these fees that were waived throughout the previous quarter , but the temporary increases on debit card and mobile deposit transaction limits remain in place . liquidity and capital through our past experience during the great recession in the late 2000s , we believe we have developed robust liquidity and capital stress tests and comprehensive liquidity and capital contingency plans . we further believe our liquidity and capital positions are strong . the company currently estimates that it has sufficient liquidity and capital to withstand an economic recession brought about by covid-19 . however the company 's regulatory capital ratios could be adversely impacted by significant credit losses and lower interest income and fees or by a longer and deeper recession than we currently anticipate . to protect against this possibility , the company issued $ 55.0 million in subordinated debt in october 2020 which is classified as tier 2 capital for regulatory purposes , and downstreamed $ 46.8 million to the bank . the company relies on cash on hand as well as dividends from its subsidiary bank to service its debt . if the company 's capital deteriorates such that its subsidiary bank is unable to pay dividends to it for an extended period of time , the company may not be able to service its debt or pay dividends to its shareholders . the company 's liquidity is impacted by loan principal and interest payment deferrals that are being granted for certain customers due to covid-19 . cash flow from loan payments was reduced due to the deferrals which were granted for three to nine months . requests for loan payment deferrals continued to significantly decline in the fourth quarter of 2020 as economic recovery in hawaii started to begin . while a significant number of loan payment deferrals ended in the fourth quarter of 2020 , we assisted some borrowers with additional deferrals as needed . additionally , liquidity could be adversely impacted if customers withdraw significant deposit balances due to covid-19 concerns . in the case of loans serviced by the company for certain third parties , including those under the federal national mortgage association ( `` fnma '' ) and federal home loan mortgage corp. ( `` fhlmc '' ) programs , the company is required to advance to the owners the payment of principal and interest on a scheduled basis for four months even when such payment was not collected from the borrower due to payment forbearance granted or payment delinquency . such amounts advanced are recorded as a receivable by the company and are expected to be collected from the borrower and or government agencies ( fnma or fhlmc ) . the company maintains access to multiple sources of liquidity . wholesale funding markets have remained open to us , but rates for short term funding have recently been volatile . the collateral that is pledged for wholesale funding lines , could lose value and may result in less funding availability . the company has access to the paycheck protection program liquidity facility ( “ ppplf ” ) , which is an extension of credit to eligible financial institutions that originate ppp loans that takes the ppp loans as collateral at face value . if funding costs are elevated for an extended period of time , it could have an adverse effect on the company 's net interest margin . if an extended recession caused large numbers of the company 's deposit customers to withdraw their funds , the company might become more reliant on volatile or more expensive sources of funding . in march 2020 , we decided to suspend our share repurchase program until we know more about the extent the pandemic will have on the economy and our business . in january 2021 , our board of directors approved a new authorization to repurchase up to $ 25 million in common stock .
","overview of results of operations 2020 vs. 2019 comparison in 2020 , we recognized net income of $ 37.3 million , or fully diluted earnings per common share ( `` eps '' ) of $ 1.32 , compared to net income of $ 58.3 million , or eps of $ 2.03 , in 2019. our roa and roe for 2020 was 0.58 % and 6.85 % , respectively , compared to 0.99 % and 11.36 % , respectively , in 2019. we recorded a provision for credit losses of $ 39.1 million in 2020 , compared to $ 6.3 million in 2019. the higher provision for credit losses was driven by the economic forecast which captures the effect of the covid-19 pandemic and led to the decline in net income , eps , roa and roe in 2020 compared to 2019. net interest income increased by $ 13.6 million from 2019 to 2020 , primarily driven by lower deposit and borrowing costs due to the historically low interest rate environment due to the pandemic environment , combined with net interest income and fees on ppp loans , partially offset by lower yields earned on the loans and investment securities portfolios . other operating income increased by $ 3.4 million from 2019 to 2020. the increase in other operating income was primarily due to higher mortgage banking income , partially offset by lower service charges on deposit accounts . in addition , the company recorded a gain of $ 2.6 million during the first quarter of 2019 from the conversion of mastercard class b common stock received during their initial public offering to class a common stock and immediate sale of the converted shares . see table 3 - components of other operating income for more information .

( abbvie ) , and a vesicular monoamine transporter 2 ( vmat2 ) inhibitor for the treatment of movement disorders , currently in phase iii development for tardive dyskinesia and phase ii development for tourette syndrome . we intend to maintain certain commercial rights to our vmat2 inhibitor program to evolve into a fully-integrated pharmaceutical company . critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon financial statements that we have prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states . the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets , liabilities and expenses , and related disclosures . on an on-going basis , we evaluate these estimates , including those related to revenue recognition , clinical trial accruals ( research and development expense ) and share-based compensation . estimates are based on historical experience , information received from third parties and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances , the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources . actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions . historically , revisions to our estimates have not resulted in a material change to the financial statements . the items in our financial statements requiring significant estimates and judgments are as follows : revenue recognition we recognize revenue for the performance of services when each of the following four criteria is met : ( i ) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists ; ( ii ) services are rendered or products are delivered ; ( iii ) the sales price is fixed or determinable ; and ( iv ) collectability is reasonably assured . 46 since 2011 , we have followed the accounting standards codification ( asc ) for revenue recognition - multiple-element arrangements , if applicable , to determine the recognition of revenue under license and collaboration agreements . the terms of these agreements generally contain multiple elements , or deliverables , which may include ( i ) licenses to our intellectual property , ( ii ) materials and technology , ( iii ) pharmaceutical supply , ( iv ) participation on joint development or joint steering committees , and ( v ) development services . the payments we receive under these arrangements typically include one or more of the following : up-front license fees ; funding of research and or development efforts ; amounts due upon the achievement of specified milestones ; manufacturing and royalties on future product sales . the asc provides guidance relating to the separation of deliverables included in an arrangement into different units of accounting and the allocation of consideration to the units of accounting . the evaluation of multiple-element arrangements requires management to make judgments about ( i ) the identification of deliverables , ( ii ) whether such deliverables are separable from the other aspects of the contractual relationship , ( iii ) the estimated selling price of each deliverable , and ( iv ) the expected period of performance for each deliverable . to determine the units of accounting under a multiple-element arrangement , we evaluate certain separation criteria , including whether the deliverables have stand-alone value , based on the relevant facts and circumstances for each arrangement . story_separator_special_tag the development activities and the manufacture of pharmaceutical products are expected to be delivered throughout the duration of the agreement . the technology license and existing know-how was delivered on the effective date of the agreement . for the year ended december 31 , 2015 , we recognized revenue under this agreement of $ 19.8 million associated with the delivery of a technology license and existing know-how . in accordance with our continuing performance obligations , $ 10.2 million of the $ 30 million up-front payment is being deferred and recognized in future periods . under the terms of the agreement , there is no general obligation to return the up-front payment for any non-contingent deliverable . we also evaluated the event-based payments under the milestone method and concluded only one immaterial event-based payment represents a substantive milestone . event-based payments will be recognized when earned . we are eligible to receive tiered royalty payments based on product sales in japan and other select asian markets . royalties will be recognized as earned in accordance with the terms of the agreement , when product sales are reported by mitsubishi tanabe , the amount can be reasonably estimated , and collectability is reasonably assured . abbvie inc. ( abbvie ) . in june 2010 , we announced an exclusive worldwide collaboration with abbvie to develop and commercialize elagolix and all next-generation gnrh antagonists ( collectively , gnrh compounds ) for women 's and men 's health . abbvie made an upfront payment of $ 75 million and agreed to make additional 48 development and regulatory event-based payments of up to $ 480 million and up to an additional $ 50 million in commercial event-based payments . we assessed event-based payments under the revised authoritative guidance for research and development milestones and determined that event-based payments prior to commencement of a phase iii clinical study , as defined in the agreement , meet the definition of a milestone in accordance with authoritative guidance as ( i ) they are events that can only be achieved in part on our past performance , ( ii ) there is substantive uncertainty at the date the arrangement was entered into that the event will be achieved and ( iii ) they result in additional payments being due to us . development and regulatory event-based payments subsequent to the commencement of a phase iii clinical study , however , currently do not meet these criteria as their achievement is based on the performance of abbvie . as of december 31 , 2015 , $ 500 million remains outstanding in future event-based payments under the agreement . however , none of the remaining event-based payments meet the definition of a milestone in accordance with authoritative accounting guidance . under the terms of the agreement , abbvie is responsible for all third-party development , marketing and commercialization costs . we received funding for certain internal collaboration expenses , which included reimbursement from abbvie for internal and external expenses related to the gnrh compounds , through the end of 2012. we will be entitled to a percentage of worldwide sales of gnrh compounds for the longer of ten years or the life of the related patent rights . under the terms of our agreement with abbvie , the collaboration effort between the parties to advance gnrh compounds towards commercialization was governed by a joint development committee with representatives from both us and abbvie . our participation in the joint development committee was determined to be a substantive deliverable under the contract , and therefore , the upfront payment was deferred and recognized over the term of the joint development committee , which was completed , as scheduled , in december 2012. abbvie may terminate the collaboration at its discretion upon 180 days ' written notice to us . in such event , we would be entitled to specified payments for ongoing clinical development and related activities and all gnrh compound product rights would revert to us . research and development expense r & d expenses consists primarily of salaries , payroll taxes , employee benefits , and share-based compensation charges , for those individuals involved in ongoing research and development efforts ; as well as scientific contractor fees , preclinical and clinical trial costs , research and development facilities costs , laboratory supply costs , and depreciation of scientific equipment . all such costs are charged to r & d expense as incurred . these expenses result from our independent r & d efforts as well as efforts associated with collaborations and in-licensing arrangements . in addition , we fund r & d and clinical trials at other companies and research institutions under agreements , which are generally cancelable . we review and accrue clinical trials expense based on work performed , which relies on estimates of total costs incurred based on patient enrollment , completion of studies and other events . we follow this method since reasonably dependable estimates of the costs applicable to various stages of a research agreement or clinical trial can be made . accrued clinical costs are subject to revisions as trials progress . revisions are charged to expense in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known . historically , revisions have not resulted in material changes to r & d expense ; however a modification in the protocol of a clinical trial or cancellation of a trial could result in a charge to our results of operations . share-based compensation we grant stock options to purchase our common stock to our employees and directors under our 2011 equity incentive plan ( the 2011 plan ) and grant stock options to certain employees pursuant to employment commencement nonstatutory stock option agreements ( inducement grants ) . we also grant certain employees stock bonuses and restricted stock units under the 2011 plan . additionally , we have outstanding options that were granted under previous option plans from which we no longer make grants .
","general and administrative general and administrative expenses were $ 32.5 million in 2015 compared to $ 18.0 million in 2014 and $ 13.3 million in 2013. the majority of this $ 14.5 million increase in expenses from 2014 to 2015 was due to higher personnel related expenses . share-based compensation expense increased by approximately $ 10.1 million from 2014 to 2015 ; approximately $ 4.6 million of which was related to prsus expense recognized in 2015. an increase in headcount and other personnel related costs accounted for approximately $ 2.1 million of additional increase in personnel expense . higher market research , licensing and other professional fees accounted for approximately $ 1.9 million of the increase in general and administrative expenses from 2014 to 2015. the $ 4.7 million increase in expenses from 2013 to 2014 resulted primarily from a $ 3.5 million increase in personnel related costs , of which $ 1.7 million was related to higher share-based compensation costs . higher market research and professional fees accounted for $ 0.6 million of the increase in general and administrative expenses from 2013 to 2014. we expect our general and administrative expenses in 2016 to increase significantly from 2015 expense levels due to increasing pre-commercialization activities related to our vmat2 inhibitor for tardive dyskinesia . net loss our net loss for 2015 was $ 88.9 million , or $ 1.05 net loss per common share , our net loss for 2014 was $ 60.5 million , or $ 0.81 net loss per common share , and our net loss for 2013 was $ 46.1 million , or $ 0.69 net loss per common share . the increase in our net loss from 2014 to 2015 was a result of the above mentioned higher overall expenses offset partially by an increase in revenue of approximately $ 19.8 million from the mitsubishi tanabe agreement .

actual results and experience to differ materially from the anticipated results or other expectations expressed in those forward-looking statements . although we believe the expectations reflected in such forward looking statements are reasonable , actual results may differ materially . factors that might cause such a difference include changes in interest rates and interest rate relationships ; demand for products and services ; the degree of competition by traditional and non-traditional competitors ; changes in banking laws and regulations ; changes in tax laws ; the impact of technological advances ; the outcomes of contingencies ; trends in customer behavior as well as their ability to repay loans ; and changes in the national and local economy . description of business

approximately 230 full time equivalent employees . overview our primary source of income is net interest income from loans and deposits . business volumes tend to be influenced by the overall economic factors including market interest rates , business spending , and consumer confidence , as well as competitive conditions within the marketplace . key items in 2011 · net income for 2011 totaled $ 3,703,000 compared to net loss of $ 2,272,000 in 2010. net income was achieved in 2011 despite charges related to the writedowns of oreo properties to fair value and other than temporary impairments

continuing high levels of nonperforming assets , a weak economy , and modest reductions in total assets and revenues . critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america and follow general practices within the financial services industry . application of these principles requires us to make estimates , assumptions , and judgments that affect the amounts reported in our financial statements and accompanying notes . these estimates , assumptions , and judgments are based on information available as of the date of the financial statements ; accordingly , as this information changes , the financial statements could reflect different estimates , assumptions , and judgments . certain policies inherently have a greater reliance on the use of estimates , assumptions , and judgments and as such have a greater possibility of producing results that could be materially different than originally reported . our most significant accounting policies are presented in the notes to the accompanying consolidated financial statements . these policies , along with the disclosures presented in the other financial statement notes and in this financial review , provide information on how significant assets and liabilities are valued in the financial statements and how those values are determined . story_separator_special_tag these modeling techniques incorporate our assessments regarding assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or the

the investment in the real estate or its fair value less estimated selling costs . the fair value of oreo is determined generally utilizing current “ as is ” appraisals performed by an independent , licensed appraiser applying an income or market value approach using observable market data . updated appraisals of oreo are generally obtained if the existing appraisal is more than 18 months old , or more frequently if there is a known deterioration in value . however , if a current appraisal is not available , the original appraised value is discounted , as appropriate , to compensate for the estimated depreciation in the value of the real estate since the date of its original appraisal . such discounts are generally estimated based upon management 's knowledge of sales of similar property within the applicable market area and its knowledge of other real estate market-related data as well as general economic trends . upon foreclosure , any fair value adjustment is charged against the allowance for loan losses . subsequent fair value adjustments are recorded in the period incurred and included in other noninterest income in the consolidated statements of income . deferred income tax assets : at december 31 , 2011 , we had net deferred tax assets of $ 11.5 million . based on our ability to offset the net deferred tax asset against expected future taxable income in carryforward years , there was no impairment of the deferred tax asset at december 31 , 2011. all available evidence , both positive and negative , was considered to determine whether , based on the weight of that evidence , impairment should be recognized . however , our forecast process includes judgmental and quantitative elements that may be subject to significant change . if our forecast of taxable income

general , the critical accounting policies that may require judgments or estimates relate specifically to revenues , allowance for doubtful accounts , inventory reserves , stock-based compensation , and income taxes . we believe the following to be critical accounting policies as they require more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements . 19 revenues from product sales are recognized at the time the product is shipped , customarily fob shipping point , at which point title passes . revenues are recognized only when collection is reasonably assured . an allowance is established if necessary for estimated returns as revenue is recognized . an allowance for doubtful accounts is established for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments . the assessment of specific receivable balances and required reserves is performed by management and discussed with the audit committee . we have identified specific customers where collection is not probable and have established specific reserves , but to the extent collection is made , the allowance will be released . additionally , if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate , resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments , additional allowances may be required . reserves are provided for excess and obsolete inventory , which are estimated based on a comparison of the quantity and cost of inventory on hand to management 's forecast of customer demand . customer demand is dependent on many factors and requires us to use significant judgment in our forecasting process . we must also make assumptions regarding the rate at which new products will be accepted in the marketplace and at which customers will transition from older products to newer products . once a reserve is established , it is maintained until the product to which it relates is sold or otherwise disposed of , even if in subsequent periods we forecast demand for the product . we measure stock-based compensation costs at fair value , including estimated forfeitures , and recognize the expense over the period that the recipient is required to provide service in exchange for the award , which generally is the vesting period . we use the black-scholes option pricing model to measure the fair value of our stock options . in determining the amount of expense to be recorded , we also estimate forfeiture rates for all awards based on historical experience to reflect the probability that employees will complete the required service period . employee retention patterns could vary in the future and result in a change to our estimated forfeiture rate which would directly impact stock-based compensation expense . we follow authoritative guidance to evaluate whether a valuation allowance should be established against our deferred tax assets based on the consideration of all available evidence using a more likely than not standard . in making such judgments , significant weight is given to evidence that can be objectively verified . we assess our deferred tax assets annually under more likely than not scenarios in which they may be realized through future income . we have determined that although we believe our deferred tax assets will be utilized at a future date , based on our recent losses and plans to continue our research and development , we have established a valuation allowance of $ 1,549,000. factors that may affect future results you should read the following factors in conjunction with the factors discussed elsewhere in this and our other filings with the securities and exchange commission and in materials incorporated by reference in these filings . the following is intended to highlight certain factors that may affect the financial condition and results of operations of biomerica , inc. and subsidiaries and are not meant to be an exhaustive discussion of risks that apply to companies such as biomerica , inc. and subsidiaries . like other businesses , biomerica , inc. and subsidiaries are susceptible to macroeconomic downturns in the united states or abroad , as were experienced recently , that may affect the general economic climate and performance of biomerica , inc. and subsidiaries or its customers . aside from general macroeconomic downturns , the additional material factors that could affect future financial results include , but are not limited to : terrorist attacks and the impact of such events ; diminished or no access to raw materials that directly enter into our manufacturing process ; shipping labor disruption or other major degradation of the ability to ship out products to end users ; inability to successfully control our margins which are affected by many factors including competition and product mix ; protracted shutdown of the u.s. border due to an escalation of terrorist or counter terrorist activity ; any changes in our business relationships with international distributors or the economic climate they operate in ; any event that has a material adverse impact on our foreign manufacturing operations may adversely affect our operations as a whole ; failure to manage the future expansion of our business could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and profitability ; possible costs in complying with government regulations and the delays in receiving required regulatory approvals or the enactment of new adverse regulations or regulatory requirements ; numerous competitors ,
","results of operations our consolidated net sales were $ 5,564,185 for fiscal 2018 compared to $ 5,791,670 for fiscal 2017. this represents a decrease of $ 227,485 , or 3.9 % . the primary reasons for the sales decrease was a result of decreased sales in europe ( $ 215,000 ) and the u.s. ( $ 189,000 ) which were offset by increases in asia of approximately $ 94,000. the decrease in sales in europe was due in part to lower private label sales and the decrease in the u.s. was a result of a decline of large purchases by a certain drug store which did not do a screening program in fiscal 2018. consolidated cost of sales in fiscal 2018 as compared to fiscal 2017 increased from $ 3,769,879 to $ 3,809,785 , or by $ 39,906. the percentage of cost of sales relative to sales increased from 65.1 % , to 68.5 % , due to various factors , primarily due to fixed costs increasing and the establishment of the maquiladora in mexico which incurred certain start-up fees . consolidated selling , general and administrative costs remained fairly constant , increasing in fiscal 2018 as compared to fiscal 2017 from $ 1,845,789 to $ 1,837,787 , or by $ 8,002 , or 0.4 % . consolidated research and development expense was $ 1,398,368 in fiscal 2018 as compared to $ 1,130,635 in fiscal 2017 , an increase of $ 267,733 , or 23.7 % , primarily as a result of increased costs related to the possible fda clearance of new gastrointestinal products and feasibility . see research and development for a more extensive description of the research being conducted . interest expense remained constant in fiscal 2018 at $ 37 as compared to $ 282 in fiscal 2017. interest and dividend income increased from $ 46,354 to $ 47,764 .

"for individual loans , a troubled debt restructuring is a formal restructuring of a loan where , for economic or legal story_separator_special_tag ​ overview great ajax corp. is a maryland corporation that is organized and operated in a manner intended to allow us to qualify as a reit . we primarily target acquisitions of rpls , including residential mortgage loans and sbc loans . rpls are mortgage loans on which at least five of the seven most recent payments have been made , or the most recent payment has been made and accepted pursuant to an agreement , or the full dollar amount to cover at least five payments has been paid in the last seven months . we opportunistically originate sbc loans that have a principal balance of up to $ 5 million and are secured by multi-family residential and commercial mixed use retail/residential properties . purchased sbc loans are generally rpls . additionally , we may invest in single-family and smaller commercial properties directly either through a foreclosure event of a loan in our mortgage portfolio or through a direct acquisition . we may also target investments in npls . npls are loans on which the most recent three payments have not been made . we may acquire npls either directly or with joint venture partners . we own a 19.8 % equity interest in our manager and an 8.0 % equity interest in the parent company of our servicer . ga-trs is a wholly owned subsidiary of the operating partnership that owns the equity interest in the manager and the servicer . we have elected to treat ga-trs as a taxable reit subsidiary under the code . our mortgage loans and real properties are serviced by the servicer , also an affiliated company . in 2014 , we formed great ajax funding llc , a wholly-owned subsidiary of the operating partnership , to act as the depositor of mortgage loans into securitization trusts and to hold the subordinated securities issued by such trusts and any additional trusts we may form for additional secured borrowings . ajx mortgage trust i and ajx mortgage trust ii are wholly-owned subsidiaries of the operating partnership formed to hold mortgage loans used as collateral for financings under our repurchase agreements . in 2015 , we formed gajx real estate llc , as a wholly-owned subsidiary of the operating partnership , to own , maintain , improve and sell certain reo purchased by us . we have elected to treat gajx real estate llc as a trs under the code . in 2018 , we formed gaea real estate corp , a wholly owned subsidiary of the operating partnership . we have elected to treat gaea real estate corp as a trs under the code . also during 2018 , we formed gaea real estate operating partnership , a wholly owned subsidiary of gaea re corp , to hold investments in commercial real estate assets . we also formed blfd holdings llc , gaea commercial properties llc , gaea commercial finance llc and gaea re llc . all entities are wholly owned subsidiaries with the exception of blfd holdings , of which 10 % is owned by a third party investors . we elected to be taxed as a reit for u.s. federal income tax purposes beginning with our taxable year ended december 31 , 2014. our qualification as a reit depends upon our ability to meet , on a continuing basis , various complex requirements under the code relating to , among other things , the sources of our gross income , the composition and values of our assets , our distribution levels and the diversity of ownership of our capital stock . we believe that we are organized in conformity with the requirements for qualification as a reit under the code , and that our current intended manner of operation enables us to meet the requirements for taxation as a reit for u.s. federal income tax purposes . our portfolio the following table outlines the carrying value of our portfolio of mortgage loan assets and single-family and smaller commercial properties as of december 31 , 2018 and december 31 , 2017 ( $ in millions ) : 43 replace_table_token_4_th we closely monitor the status of our mortgage loans and , through our servicer , work with our borrowers to improve their payment records . market trends and outlook we believe that certain cyclical trends continue to drive a significant realignment within the mortgage sector . these trends and their effects include : historically low interest rates and elevated operating costs resulting from new regulatory requirements that continue to drive sales of residential mortgage assets by banks and other mortgage lenders ; ​ declining home ownership due to rising prices , low inventory and increased down payment requirements that have increased the demand for single-family and multi-family residential rental properties ; ​ rising home prices are increasing homeowner equity and reducing the incidence of strategic default ; ​ rising prices have resulted in millions of homeowners being in the money to refinance ; ​ the dodd-frank risk retention rules for asset backed securities have reduced the universe of participants in the securitization markets ; ​ the lack of a robust market for non-conforming mortgage loans in the aftermath of the financial crisis ​ ; and continuing increases in interest rates will result in lower refinancing volume and home prices increases will slow . the current market landscape is also generating new opportunities in residential mortgage-related whole loan strategies . the origination of subprime and alternative residential mortgage loans remain substantially below 2008 levels and the qualified mortgage and ability-to-repay rule requirements have put pressure on new originations . additionally , many banks and other mortgage lenders have increased their credit standards and down payment requirements for originating new loans . the combination of these factors has also resulted in a significant number of families that can not qualify to obtain new residential mortgage loans . story_separator_special_tag our preferred resolution methodology is to modify npls . once successfully modified and there is a period of continued performance , we expect that borrowers will typically refinance these loans at or near the estimated value of the underlying property . we believe modification followed by refinancing generates near-term cash flows , provides the highest possible economic outcome for us and is a socially responsible business strategy because it keeps more families in their homes . in certain circumstances , we may also consider selling these modified loans . through historical experience , we expect that many of our npls will enter into foreclosure or similar proceedings , ultimately becoming reo that we can sell or convert into single-family rental properties that we believe will generate long-term returns for our stockholders . our reo properties may be converted into single-family rental properties or they may be sold through reo liquidation and short sale processes . we expect the timelines for each of the different processes to vary significantly . the exact nature of resolution will depend on a number of factors that are beyond our control , including borrower willingness , property value , availability of refinancing , interest rates , conditions in the financial markets , regulatory environment and other factors . to avoid the 100 % prohibited transaction tax on the sale of dealer property by a reit , we may dispose of assets that may be treated as held “ primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of a trade or business ” by contributing or selling the asset to a trs prior to marketing the asset for sale . the state of the real estate market and home prices will determine proceeds from any sale of real estate . we will opportunistically and on an asset-by-asset basis determine whether to rent any reo we acquire , whether upon foreclosure or otherwise , we may determine to sell such assets if they do not meet our investment criteria . in addition , while we seek to track real estate price trends and estimate the effects of those trends on the valuations of our portfolios of residential mortgage loans , 45 future real estate values are subject to influences beyond our control . generally , rising home prices are expected to positively affect our results . conversely , declining real estate prices are expected to negatively affect our results . conversion to rental property . from time to time we will retain an reo property as a rental property and may acquire rental properties through direct purchases at attractive prices . the key variables that will affect our residential rental revenues over the long-term will be the extent to which we acquire properties , which , in turn , will depend on the amount of our capital invested , average occupancy and rental rates in our owned rental properties . we expect the timeline to convert multi-family and single-family loans , into rental properties will vary significantly by loan , which could result in variations in our revenue and our operating performance from period to period . there are a variety of factors that may inhibit our ability , through the servicer , to foreclose upon a residential mortgage loan and get access to the real property within the time frames we model as part of our valuation process . these factors include , without limitation : state foreclosure timelines and the associated deferrals ( including from litigation ) ; unauthorized occupants of the property ; u.s. federal , state or local legislative action or initiatives designed to provide homeowners with assistance in avoiding residential mortgage loan foreclosures that may delay the foreclosure process ; u.s. federal government programs that require specific procedures to be followed to explore the non-foreclosure outcome of a residential mortgage loan prior to the commencement of a foreclosure proceeding ; and declines in real estate values and high levels of unemployment and underemployment that increase the number of foreclosures and place additional pressure on the already overburdened judicial and administrative systems . we do not expect to retain a material number of single family residential properties for use as rentals . we do , however , intend to focus , on retaining multi-unit residences derived from foreclosures , or outright purchases as rentals . expenses . our expenses primarily consist of the fees and expenses payable by us under the management agreement and the servicing agreement . additionally , our manager incurs direct , out-of-pocket costs related to managing our business , which are contractually reimbursable by us . loan transaction expense is the cost of performing due diligence on pools of mortgage loans under consideration for purchase . professional fees are primarily for legal , accounting and tax services . real estate operating expense consists of the ownership and operating costs of our reo properties , both held-for-sale and as rentals , and includes any charges for impairments to the carrying value of these assets , which may be significant . interest expense , which is subtracted from our interest income to arrive at net interest income , consists of the costs to borrow money . changes in home prices . as discussed above , generally , rising home prices are expected to positively affect our results , particularly as this should result in greater levels of re-performance of mortgage loans , faster refinancing of those mortgage loans , more re-capture of principal on greater than 100 % ltv ( loan-to-value ) mortgage loans and increased recovery of the principal of the mortgage loans upon sale of any reo . conversely , declining real estate prices are expected to negatively affect our results , particularly if the home prices should decline below our purchase price for the loans and especially if borrowers determine that it is better to strategically default as their equity in their homes decline .

"cartons , carriers and containers are designed to protect and hold products . product offerings include a variety of laminated , coated and printed packaging structures that are produced from the company 's cuk , crb , and sbs . innovative designs and combinations of paperboard , films , foils , metallization , holographics and embossing are customized to the individual needs of the customers . the company is implementing strategies ( i ) to expand market share in its current markets and to identify and penetrate new markets ; ( ii ) to capitalize on the company 's customer relationships , business competencies , and mills and folding carton assets ; ( iii ) to develop and market innovative , sustainable products and applications ; and ( iv ) to continue to reduce costs by focusing on operational improvements . the company 's ability to fully implement its strategies and achieve its objectives may be influenced by a variety of factors , many of which are beyond its control , such as inflation of raw material and other costs , which the company can not always pass through to its customers , and the effect of overcapacity in the worldwide paperboard packaging industry . significant factors that impact the company 's business and results of operations impact of inflation/deflation . the company 's cost of sales consists primarily of energy ( including natural gas , fuel oil and electricity ) , pine and hardwood pulp , chemicals , secondary fibers , purchased paperboard , aluminum foil , ink , plastic films and resins , depreciation expense and labor . costs increased year over year by $ 73.6 million in 2018 and increased year over year by $ 95.8 million in 2017 . the higher costs in 2018 were due to freight ( $ 25.9 million ) , labor and benefit costs ( $ 20.9 million ) , chemicals ( $ 19.4 million ) , external board ( $ 17.7 million ) , and other costs , net ( $ 4.2 million ) , partially offset by lower secondary fiber cost ( $ 14.5 million ) . because the price of natural gas experiences significant volatility , the company has entered into contracts designed to manage risks associated with future variability in cash flows caused by changes in the price of natural gas . the company has entered into natural gas swap contracts to hedge prices for a portion of its expected usage for 2019 . since negotiated sales contracts and the market largely determine the pricing for its products , the company is at times limited in its ability to raise prices and pass through to its customers any inflationary or other cost increases that the company may incur . 23 commitment to cost reduction . in light of continuing margin pressure throughout the packaging industry , the company has programs in place that are designed to reduce costs , improve productivity and increase profitability . the company utilizes a global continuous improvement initiative that uses statistical process control to help design and manage many types of activities , including production and maintenance . this includes a six sigma process focused on reducing variable and fixed manufacturing and administrative costs . the company has expanded the continuous improvement initiative to include the deployment of lean sigma principles into manufacturing and supply chain services . the company 's ability to continue to successfully implement its business strategies and to realize anticipated savings and operating efficiencies is subject to significant business , economic and competitive uncertainties and contingencies , many of which are beyond the company 's control . if the company can not successfully implement the strategic cost reductions or other cost savings plans it may not be able to continue to compete successfully against other manufacturers . in addition , any failure to generate the anticipated efficiencies and savings could adversely affect the company 's financial results . competition and market factors . as some products can be packaged in different types of materials , the company 's sales are affected by competition from other manufacturers ' cuk , crb , sbs , folding box board , and recycled clay-coated news . additional substitute products also include plastic , shrink film and corrugated containers . in addition , while the company has long-term relationships with many of its customers , the underlying contracts may be re-bid or renegotiated from time to time , and the company may not be successful in renewing on favorable terms or at all . the company works to maintain market share through efficiency , product innovation and strategic sourcing to its customers ; however , pricing and other competitive pressures may occasionally result in the loss of a customer relationship . in addition , the company 's sales historically are driven by consumer buying habits in the markets its customers serve . changes in consumer dietary habits and preferences , increases in the costs of living , unemployment rates , access to credit markets , as well as other macroeconomic factors , may negatively affect consumer spending behavior . new product introductions and promotional activity by the company 's customers and the company 's introduction of new packaging products also impact its sales . debt obligations . the company had an aggregate principal amount of $ 2,967.7 million of outstanding debt obligations as of december 31 , 2018 . this debt has consequences for the company , as it requires a portion of cash flow from operations to be used for the payment of principal and interest , exposes the company to the risk of increased interest rates and may restrict the company 's ability to obtain additional financing . covenants in the company 's amended and restated credit agreement , the term loan credit agreement and indentures may , among other things , restrict the ability of the company to dispose of assets , incur guarantee obligations , prepay other indebtedness , repurchase stock , pay dividends , make other restricted payments and make acquisitions or other investments . story_separator_special_tag the effective tax rate for 2017 is significantly different than the statutory rate primarily due to the effect of the enactment of the tax cuts and jobs act ( the `` act '' ) on december 22 , 2017. the act significantly reduced u.s. federal corporate income tax rates , which resulted in an income tax benefit of $ 156.3 million as a result of the remeasurement of the company 's domestic net deferred tax liabilities . in addition , the act required companies to record a one-time transition tax impact based on foreign earnings and profits which resulted in additional tax expense in the current year of $ 20.5 million . equity income of unconsolidated entity equity income of unconsolidated entity was $ 1.7 million in 2017 and $ 1.8 million in 2016 and is related to the company 's equity investment through its gpil subsidiary in the joint venture , rengo riverwood packaging , ltd. segment reporting the company has three reportable segments as follows : paperboard mills includes the eight north american paperboard mills which produce primarily cuk , crb , and sbs , which is primarily consumed internally to produce paperboard packaging for the americas and europe paperboard packaging segments . the remaining paperboard is sold externally to a wide variety of paperboard packaging converters and brokers . the paperboard mills segment net sales represent the sale of paperboard only to external customers . the effect of intercompany transfers to the paperboard packaging segments has been eliminated from the paperboard mills segment to reflect the economics of the integration of these segments . americas paperboard packaging includes paperboard packaging folding cartons and cups , lids , and food containers sold primarily to consumer packaged goods , quick-service restaurants and foodservice companies serving the food , beverage , and consumer product markets in the americas . 28 europe paperboard packaging includes paperboard packaging primarily folding cartons sold primarily to consumer packaged goods companies serving the food , beverage and consumer product markets in europe . the company allocates certain mill and corporate costs to the reportable segments to appropriately represent the economics of these segments . the corporate and other caption includes the pacific rim and australia operating segments and unallocated corporate and one-time costs . these segments are evaluated by the chief operating decision maker based primarily on income from operations , as adjusted for depreciation and amortization . the accounting policies of the reportable segments are the same as those described in note 1 in the notes to consolidated financial statements included herein under “ item 8. financial statements and supplementary data .

achieved financial objectives and strengthened our balance sheet in 2016 , we delivered solid consolidated adjusted ebitda of $ 217.0 million , within our guidance range of $ 210 million to $ 235 million . additionally , we generated strong operating cash flows of $ 219.1 million , well above our guidance of $ 150 million to $ 170 million , driven largely by coal inventory management and lower coal prices . entering 2016 , the partnership anticipated utilizing excess liquidity of at least $ 60 million to meaningfully de-lever the partnership 's balance sheet in 2016 . during the year , together with partnership , we reduced total consolidated debt outstanding by approximately $ 145 million , including repurchases of approximately $ 90 million of the partnership 's notes for approximately $ 65 million of cash . additionally , during 2016 , the company repaid $ 60.4 million on the revolving facility . as a result , we reduced our total gross debt / adjusted ebitda leverage to 3.95x . managed through challenging market conditions in 2016 , we successfully managed through various market challenges , including those in the coal and steel industries as well as the broader industrial and energy markets as a whole . in recent years , our steel customers have been challenged on lower prices driven in part by unfairly traded imports and the strong u.s. dollar . as a result , in late 2015 , united states steel corporation ( `` u.s. steel '' ) and ak steel holding corporation ( `` ak steel '' ) idled their granite city and ashland blast furnace operations , respectively . we reduced production at our haverhill ii facility by 75 thousand tons , for which we were made whole by ak steel under our take-or-pay contract . we also shifted production levels at our granite city facility to the second half of the year to accommodate u.s. steel 's needs . neither of these actions impacted earnings from these facilities or our annual consolidated adjusted ebitda . 38 during 2016 , our coal logistics ' export coal customers faced global headwinds of oversupply and a strong u.s. dollar . the argus/mccloskey 's coal price index report ( `` api2 index price '' ) , the benchmark price used for u.s. thermal coal exports to europe , fell to multi-year lows , challenging the profitability of our customers ' coal exports . as a result , we reached an agreement with murray american coal ( `` murray '' ) and foresight energy lp ( `` foresight '' ) , our two primary cmt customers , to provide certain volume-based incentives , in the form of ancillary revenue rebates , in exchange for a limited one-year contract extension . these rebates , which phase out as api2 index prices rise , are only in place for 2016 and 2017 , and are intended to provide incentives to our customers to ship more coal through convent marine terminal ( `` cmt '' ) during periods of low api2 index prices . by late 2016 , the api2 index price had rebounded , resulting in the elimination of the new rebate incentive should prices stay at or above the year end level . the improvement in the api2 index price also improved the profitability of our customers ' coal exports and resulted in a significant increase in volumes through cmt during the fourth quarter 2016. our coal logistics ' domestic coal customers were also challenged with lower coal prices throughout most of 2016 as well as mild weather conditions , driving down volumes across the segment . we responded by aggressively managing costs , primarily at kanawha river terminals , llc ( `` krt '' ) , to partially mitigate the impacts of these lower volumes . the domestic metallurgical coal markets remained challenged during early 2016 as the drastic and sustained decline in coal prices led to several coal producers filing for chapter 11 bankruptcy protection . despite our own diligent efforts to reduce costs by rationalizing our mining footprint , this challenged environment was likely to prevent us from generating positive cash flow from our mining operations for the foreseeable future . story_separator_special_tag excluding our indiana harbor facility and the impact of the continued 75 thousand ton turn down at our haverhill ii facility , for which we will again be made whole by ak steel , we expect our domestic coke fleet will deliver contract maximum volumes to our take-or-pay customers . we expect the increase in metallurgical coal prices will result in a higher yield gains across our domestic coke fleet . finally , while we do not anticipate incremental spot sales during the year , we remain positioned to deliver spot tons to the market should coke demand rise throughout 2017. we believe our coal logistics assets are well positioned to further serve the thermal and metallurgical coal markets as these industries continue to recover , and we expect year-over-year improvement in adjusted ebitda . in 2017 , we expect adjusted ebitda of approximately $ 67 million to $ 72 million , up from $ 63.9 million in 2016. our cmt export facility is uniquely positioned to serve customers via direct rail access and has the ability to load multi-category vessels with a new , state-of-the-art ship loader . given the recent significant improvement in api2 index prices , we expect cmt will handle approximately 8 million tons of coal in 2017 on behalf of our two long-term , take-or-pay customers , foresight energy and murray energy , an improvement of approximately 4 million tons versus 2016. we expect merchant volumes at cmt will continue in 2017 , and we will continue to seek additional opportunities to optimize the facility by securing additional merchant business . additionally , at our remaining coal logistics terminals , we anticipate continued volume recovery due to the recent strengthening of domestic coal fundamentals . we remain committed to maintaining a safe work environment and ensuring compliance with applicable laws and regulations . 40 execute further oven rebuilds at our indiana harbor cokemaking operations in 2017 , we will remain focused on stabilizing our indiana harbor plant and improving its operating and financial performance . to date we have executed a total of 86 rebuilds under our holistic oven rebuild initiative , which began in 2015 , and we intend to rebuild an additional 53 ovens in 2017. we anticipate these rebuilds will cost approximately $ 26 million , including capital expenditures of approximately $ 20 million , in 2017. additionally , in 2017 , we expect to spend approximately $ 5 million of expense to incorporate lessons learned during the rebuilds completed in 2016 into the ovens rebuilt in 2015. we expect to complete the rebuild initiative and return our indiana harbor facility 's operations to profitability in 2018. while we expect this initiative will improve the long-term stability of the facility , we expect overall production in 2017 to remain at approximately 900 thousand tons . we also expect increased operations and maintenance expense in 2017 as ovens are taken out of service to complete the necessary rebuilds . therefore , our consolidated adjusted ebitda guidance assumes a loss of approximately $ 13 million at our indiana harbor facility in 2017. complete the proposed simplification transaction on october 31 , 2016 , the company announced that it had submitted a proposal to the board of directors of the general partner of the partnership to acquire all of the partnership 's common units not already owned by the company ( `` simplification transaction '' ) . the proposed transaction is to be structured as a merger of the partnership with a wholly-owned subsidiary of the company , and is subject to the negotiation and execution of definitive documents and approval of our board of directors and the conflicts committee of the partnership 's board of directors . the conflicts committee , which is composed of only the independent directors of the board of directors of the partnership 's general partner , is considering the proposal pursuant to applicable procedures established in the partnership 's partnership agreement and the conflicts committee 's charter . the transaction also will require majority approval of our common stockholders . we own the majority of the partnership 's common units and intend to vote in favor of the transaction . the proposed simplification transaction is also conditioned upon receipt of customary regulatory approvals . successful completion of this transaction will result in enhanced financial flexibility for the consolidated enterprise , including the ability to establish a sustainable dividend , further de-lever the balance sheet at an accelerated pace and fund growth . additionally , the consolidated enterprise will have greater flexibility to pursue accretive mergers and acquisitions and or organic growth projects as targets will no longer be limited to those producing qualifying income . this will expand our growth opportunities to various customer and product adjacencies where suncoke can add value to an acquisition or greenfield project immediately . to the extent that there are attractive bolt-on opportunities in coke and coal logistics , we will look to continue to extend and grow these two platforms . finally , to the extent we have excess cash , we may return additional capital to shareholders . subsequent to the company proposal for the simplification transaction , in january 2017 , the internal revenue service announced its decision to exclude cokemaking as a qualifying income generating activity . subsequent to the 10-year transition period , certain cokemaking entities in the partnership will become taxable as corporations . see `` part i. item 1. business '' for further discussion of this regulation . accomplish our 2017 financial objectives in 2017 , we will remain focused on accomplishing our financial objectives and expect to deliver consolidated adjusted ebitda of between $ 220 million and $ 235 million . this increase reflects higher coal logistics volumes , a full-year of savings from the coal mining divestiture and benefits from a cost rationalization exercise we completed in 2016 , in which we partnered with third-party experts to complete a full review of our operational and administrative costs .

the world health organization declared the covid-19 outbreak to be a global pandemic and the united states declared a national public health emergency . the covid-19 pandemic has significantly disrupted consumer demand , as well as the company 's restaurant operations . following the pandemic declaration in march 2020 , federal , state and local governments began to respond to the public health crisis by requiring social distancing , `` stay at home '' directives , and mandatory closure of all of our locations . as a result of state and local governments lifting “ stay at home ” orders and mandatory shut-down requirements from may through august 2020 , the company has reopened all of its properties , with the exception of thunder grill in washington , d.c. , at varying levels of limited capacity as allowed by federal , state and local governments . due to the impact of the covid-19 pandemic , during the year ended october 3 , 2020 , subsequent to reopening after initial shut-downs , the company has temporarily closed several restaurants , typically for three to seven days . the coronavirus has caused unprecedented business disruptions , especially in the hospitality industry . although we have experienced some recovery from the initial impact of covid-19 , the long-term impact of covid-19 on the economy and on our business remains uncertain , the duration and scope of which can not currently be predicted . as a result of these developments , the company is experiencing a significant negative impact on its revenues , results of operations and cash flows , which could negatively impact its ability to meet its obligations over the next 12 months . however , we believe that our existing cash balances , which include the proceeds from paycheck protection program loans ( see note 10 - notes payable of the consolidated financial statements ) and actions taken by management , set out below and otherwise , will be sufficient to meet our liquidity and capital spending requirements through december 23 , 2021. in response to the business disruption and liquidity concerns caused by the covid-19 pandemic , the company has taken the following actions , which management expects will enable it to meet its obligations over the next 12 months : while restaurants were closed or continue to be closed , we furloughed all hourly employees and approximately 95 % of salaried restaurant management personnel , while enacting salary reductions for all remaining restaurant management personnel . as restaurants re-opened , restaurant management salaries were restored to 70 % of pre-pandemic amounts . if a location produced sustained cash flow , restaurant management salaries were restored to 100 % of pre-pandemic amounts . initially reduced the pay of all corporate and administrative staff by 50 % to 75 % and senior management salaries by 75 % to 95 % . as of october 3 , 2020 , most corporate salaries have been restored to 65 % of pre-pandemic levels . in addition , the board waived its fees for the balance of 2020. entered into a payment suspension agreement with our bank which deferred aggregate principal payments of $ 675,000 due on june 1 , 2020 to the respective loan maturity dates and an agreement to extend the maturity dates of our revolving credit facility ( see note 10 - notes payable of the consolidated financial statements ) . in addition , the bank agreed to relaxed financial covenants through fiscal q3 2021. canceled the payment of the $ 0.25 dividend declared on march 2 , 2020 . 16 suspended future dividend payments until such time as the board deems appropriate to reinstate . canceled or delayed all non-essential capital expenditures . suspended the vast majority of lease payments while our restaurants were closed as a result of government mandated shutdowns , and attempted to negotiate rent concessions , abatements and deferrals with these landlords to reduce the lease payments . while some landlords have agreed to concessions , several negotiations are still ongoing as of the date of this filing and we will attempt to obtain further concessions through april 2021 at many of our leased properties . however , there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in obtaining the relief it is seeking . certain company subsidiaries applied for and received a total of approximately $ 15.0 million of loans under the paycheck protection program of the coronavirus aid , relief and economic security act ( the “ cares act ” ) , which was enacted march 27 , 2020. utilized additional provisions of the cares act to obtain tax savings as well as the deferral of our portion of social security taxes to future years . due to the rapid development and fluidity of this situation , management can not determine the ultimate impact that the covid-19 pandemic will have on the company 's consolidated financial condition , liquidity , future results of operations , suppliers , industry , and workforce and therefore any prediction as to the ultimate material adverse impact on the company 's consolidated financial condition , liquidity , and future results of operations is uncertain . the disruption in operations has led the company to consider the impact of the covid-19 pandemic on its liquidity , debt covenant compliance , and recoverability of long-lived and rou assets , goodwill and intangible assets , among others . story_separator_special_tag depreciation and amortization expense for the year ended october 3 , 2020 decreased as compared with the same period of last year primarily as a result of lower charges in the current period as a result of asset impairments in the fourth quarter of 2019 and second quarter of 2020 partially offset by depreciation on improvements placed in service in fiscal 2020. loss on termination of lease on april 2 , 2020 , the company advised the landlord of a catering space in new york , ny that we would be terminating the lease . in connection with this notification , the company recorded a loss of $ 364,000 during the 13 weeks ended march 28 , 2020 , consisting of ( i ) rent accrued in accordance with the termination provisions of the lease , ( ii ) the write-off of the unamortized balance of purchased leasehold rights , ( iii ) the write-off of our security deposit , ( iv ) the write-off of rou assets and related lease liabilities , and ( v ) the write-off of net book value of fixed assets . 20 loss on closure of durgin-park as of december 29 , 2018 , the company determined that it would not be able to operate durgin-park profitably due to decreased traffic at the faneuil hall marketplace in boston , ma , where it was located , and rising labor costs . as a result , included in the statement of operations for the year ended october 3 , 2020 are losses on closure in the amount of $ 1,106,000 consisting of : ( i ) impairment of trademarks in the amount of $ 721,000 , ( ii ) accelerated depreciation of fixed assets in the amount of $ 333,000 , and ( iii ) write-offs of prepaid and other expenses in the amount of $ 52,000. the restaurant closed on january 12 , 2019. i mpairment loss from write-down of long-lived assets management continually evaluates unfavorable cash flows , if any , related to underperforming restaurants . periodically it is concluded that certain properties have become impaired based on their existing and anticipated future economic outlook in their respective markets . in such instances , we may impair assets to reduce their carrying values to fair values . estimated fair values of impaired properties are based on comparable valuations , cash flows and or management judgment . as a result of the underperformance and increased competition at clyde frazier 's wine and dine , the company has recorded an impairment charge of $ 2,857,000 in the year ended september 28 , 2019 related to this property . income taxes our income tax expense , deferred tax assets and liabilities , and liabilities for uncertain tax positions reflect management 's best estimate of current and future taxes to be paid . we are subject to income tax in numerous state taxing jurisdictions . significant judgment and estimates are required in the determination of consolidated income tax expense . the provision for income taxes reflects federal income taxes calculated on a consolidated basis and state and local income taxes which are calculated on a separate entity basis . for state and local income tax purposes , certain losses incurred by a subsidiary may only be used to offset that subsidiary 's income , with the exception of the restaurants operating in the district of columbia . accordingly , our overall effective tax rate has varied depending on the level of income and losses incurred at individual subsidiaries . deferred income taxes arise from temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the consolidated financial statements , which will result in taxable or deductible amounts in the future . in evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets in the jurisdiction from which they arise , we consider all available positive and negative evidence , including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities , projected future taxable income , tax-planning strategies , and results of recent operations . the assumptions about future taxable income require the use of significant judgment and are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying businesses . on march 27 , 2020 , the coronavirus aid , relief and economic security act ( `` cares act '' ) was enacted to provide economic relief to those impacted by the covid-19 pandemic . the cares act made various tax law changes including among other things ( i ) modifications to the federal net operating loss rules including permitting federal net operating losses incurred in 2018 , 2019 , and 2020 to be carried back to the five preceding taxable years in order to generate a refund of previously paid income taxes ( ii ) enhanced recoverability of amt tax credit carryforwards ( iii ) increased the limitation under irc section 163 ( j ) for 2019 and 2020 to permit additional expensing of interest , and ( iv ) enacted a technical correction so that qualified improvement property can be immediately expensed under irc section 168 ( k ) . as a result of the cares act , the company recorded an income tax receivable of $ 2,673,000 as it is expecting to carryback its current year estimated taxable losses for fiscal year 2020 and recover prior taxes paid . the company recorded an income tax benefit of $ 1,022,000 related to the carryback as the company was subject to higher federal corporate income tax rates in prior periods than the current statutory tax rate of 21 % . on november 18 , 2020 , the irs issued revenue ruling 2020-27 that treats expenses funded by ppp loans as non-deductible for tax purposes if a business reasonably expects that a ppp loan will be forgiven in the future .
","results of operations the company 's operating loss for the year ended october 3 , 2020 was $ ( 7,796,000 ) as compared to operating income of $ 3,246,000 for the year ended september 28 , 2019 which included a loss of $ 1,106,000 relating to the closure of durgin-park located in boston , ma . this decrease resulted primarily from the government mandated closure of all of our restaurants in march 2020 in connection with the covid-19 pandemic and a $ 364,000 loss on the termination of a lease . although state and local governments have lifted “ stay at home ” orders and mandatory shut-down requirements at varying levels of limited capacity from may through september 2020 and the company has reopened all of its properties , with the exception of thunder grill in washington , d.c. , our revenues and operating results continue to be well below prior periods . in addition to the decrease in restaurant revenue from the mandatory closures and operating at varying levels of limited capacity , the company estimates that it incurred approximately $ 3,150,000 of costs directly related to covid-19 during the year ended october 3 , 2020 consisting primarily of payments to employees for paid-time off during restaurant closures , inventory waste , and rent and rent related costs for closed restaurants from the day that they closed . recently , there has been a significant increase in reported covid-19 cases in states where we have significant locations . this has resulted in some local governments responding by taking additional measures , including implementing a further reduction of in-restaurant capacity in certain locations . although this is a developing situation , to this point these capacity reductions have not had a significant impact on our overall sales trends .

financial measures and indicators for our business are earnings per share , dividends declared , core earnings , and book value per share . for the three months ended december 31 , 2019 , we recorded earnings per share of $ 0.59 , declared a dividend of $ 0.62 per share , and reported $ 0.68 per share of core earnings . in addition , our book value per share as of december 31 , 2019 was $ 27.82 , an increase of $ 0.62 per share relative to december 31 , 2018. for the year ended december 31 , 2019 , we recorded earnings per share of $ 2.35 , declared aggregate dividends of $ 2.48 per share , and reported $ 2.70 per share of core earnings . as further described below , core earnings is a measure that is not prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america , or gaap . we use core earnings to evaluate our performance excluding the effects of certain transactions and gaap adjustments that we believe are not necessarily indicative of our current loan activity and operations . earnings per share and dividends declared the following table sets forth the calculation of basic and diluted net income per share and dividends declared per share ( $ in thousands , except per share data ) : replace_table_token_3_th ( 1 ) represents net income attributable to blackstone mortgage trust . core earnings core earnings is a non-gaap measure , which we define as gaap net income ( loss ) , including realized gains and losses not otherwise included in gaap net income ( loss ) , and excluding ( i ) non-cash equity compensation expense , ( ii ) depreciation and amortization , ( iii ) unrealized gains ( losses ) , ( iv ) net income ( loss ) attributable to our legacy portfolio , and ( v ) certain non-cash items . core earnings may also be adjusted from time to time to exclude one-time events pursuant to changes in gaap and certain other non-cash charges as determined by our manager , subject to approval by a majority of our independent directors . we believe that core earnings provides meaningful information to consider in addition to our net income and cash flow from operating activities determined in accordance with gaap . this adjusted measure helps us to evaluate our performance excluding the effects of certain transactions and gaap adjustments that we believe are not necessarily indicative of our current loan portfolio and operations . story_separator_special_tag in addition to cash coupon , all-in yield includes the amortization of deferred origination and extension fees , loan origination costs , and purchase discounts , as well as the accrual of exit fees . ( 6 ) maximum maturity assumes all extension options are exercised by the borrower , however our loans and other investments may be repaid prior to such date . as of december 31 , 2019 , 59 % of our loans and other investments were subject to yield maintenance or other prepayment restrictions and 41 % were open to repayment by the borrower without penalty . ( 7 ) based on ltv as of the dates loans and other investments were originated or acquired by us . 66 the following table details the floating benchmark rates for our investment portfolio as of december 31 , 2019 ( $ / /£/a $ /c $ in thousands ) : replace_table_token_8_th ( 1 ) we use foreign currency forward contracts to protect the value or fix the amount of certain investments or cash flows in terms of the u.s. dollar . we earn forward points on our forward contracts that reflect the interest rate differentials between the applicable base rate for our foreign currency investments and usd libor . these forward contracts effectively convert the foreign currency rate exposure for such investments to usd libor . ( 2 ) the cash coupon and all-in yield of our fixed rate loans are reflected as a spread over usd libor for purposes of the weighted-averages . in addition to cash coupon , all-in yield includes the amortization of deferred origination and extension fees , loan origination costs , and purchase discounts , as well as the accrual of exit fees . the charts below detail the geographic distribution and types of properties securing our investment portfolio , as of december 31 , 2019 : refer to section vi of this item 7 for details of our loan portfolio , on a loan-by-loan basis . asset management we actively manage the investments in our loan portfolio and exercise the rights afforded to us as a lender , including collateral level budget approvals , lease approvals , loan covenant enforcement , escrow/reserve management , collateral release approvals , and other rights that we may negotiate . as discussed in note 2 to our consolidated financial statements , our manager performs a quarterly review of our loan portfolio , assesses the performance of each loan , and assigns it a risk rating between “ 1 ” and “ 5 , ” from less 67 risk to greater risk . the following table allocates the principal balance and total loan exposure balances based on our internal risk ratings ( $ in thousands ) : replace_table_token_9_th ( 1 ) in certain instances , we finance our loans through the non-recourse sale of a senior loan interest that is not included in our consolidated financial statements . see note 2 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion . total loan exposure encompasses the entire loan we originated and financed , including $ 688.5 million of such non-consolidated senior interests as of december 31 , 2019 . ( 2 ) excludes investment exposure to the $ 930.0 million 2018 single asset securitization . refer to notes 4 and 16 to our consolidated financial statements for details of the subordinated risk retention interest we own in the 2018 single asset securitization . the weighted-average risk rating of our total loan exposure was 2.8 and 2.7 as of as of december 31 , 2019 and december 31 , 2018 , respectively . the increase was driven primarily by new loans originated during 2019 , the majority of which were rated 3 at origination . multifamily joint venture as of december 31 , 2019 , our multifamily joint venture held $ 670.5 million of loans , which are included in the loan disclosures above . refer to note 2 to our consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of our multifamily joint venture . portfolio financing our portfolio financing arrangements include secured credit facilities , asset-specific financings , a revolving credit agreement , loan participations sold , non-consolidated senior interests , and securitized debt obligations . 68 the following table details our portfolio financing ( $ in thousands ) : replace_table_token_10_th ( 1 ) these non-consolidated senior interests provide structural leverage for our net investments which are reflected in the form of mezzanine loans or other subordinate interests on our balance sheet and in our results of operations . secured credit facilities the following table details our secured credit facilities ( $ in thousands ) : replace_table_token_11_th ( 1 ) potential borrowings represents the total amount we could draw under each facility based on collateral already approved and pledged . when undrawn , these amounts are immediately available to us at our sole discretion under the terms of each credit facility . ( 2 ) represents the principal balance of the collateral assets . ( 3 ) these facilities finance the loan investments of our consolidated multifamily joint venture . refer to note 2 to our consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of our multifamily joint venture . 69 asset-specific financings the following table details our asset-specific financings ( $ in thousands ) : replace_table_token_12_th ( 1 ) these floating rate loans and related liabilities are indexed to the various benchmark rates relevant in each arrangement in terms of currency and payment frequency . therefore the net exposure to each benchmark rate is in direct proportion to our net assets indexed to that rate . in addition to cash coupon , yield/cost includes the amortization of deferred origination fees / financing costs . ( 2 ) other than amounts guaranteed on an asset-by-asset basis , borrowings under our asset-specific financings are non-recourse to us . ( 3 ) the weighted-average term is determined based on the maximum maturity of the corresponding loans , assuming all extension options are exercised by the borrower . each of our asset-specific financings is term-matched to the corresponding collateral loans .
","operating results the following table sets forth information regarding our consolidated results of operations for the years ended december 31 , 2019 , 2018 , and 2017 ( $ in thousands , except per share data ) : replace_table_token_17_th income from loans and other investments , net income from loans and other investments , net increased $ 27.7 million during the year ended december 31 , 2019 compared to the year ended december 31 , 2018. the increase was primarily due to ( i ) an increase in the weighted-average principal balance of our loan portfolio by $ 3.0 billion during the year ended december 31 , 2019 , compared to the year ended december 31 , 2018 and ( ii ) an increase in the weighted-average libor and other floating rate indices in 2019 , compared to 2018. this was offset by ( i ) the increase in the weighted-average principal balance of our outstanding financing arrangements , which increased by $ 2.6 billion during the year ended december 31 , 2019 , compared to the year ended december 31 , 2018 , and ( ii ) a decrease in non-recurring prepayment fee income . income from loans and other investments , net increased $ 93.4 million during the year ended december 31 , 2018 compared to the year ended december 31 , 2017. the increase was primarily due to ( i ) an increase in the weighted-average principal balance of our loan portfolio by $ 2.5 billion during the year ended december 31 , 2018 , compared to the year ended december 31 , 2017 , ( ii ) an increase in non-recurring prepayment fee income , and ( iii ) an increase in libor and other floating rate indices during 2018. this was offset by the increase in the weighted-average principal balance of our outstanding financing arrangements , which increased by $ 2.0 billion during the year ended december 31 , 2018 , compared to the year ended december 31 , 2017. other expenses other expenses include management and incentive

"the company charters its vessels to commercial shippers and foreign governments and governmental agencies primarily on voyage charters and on time story_separator_special_tag the following is a discussion and analysis of ( i ) industry operations that have an impact on the company 's financial position and results of operations , ( ii ) the company 's financial condition at december 31 , 2016 and 2015 and its results of operations comparing the years ended december 31 , 2016 and 2015 and the years ended december 31 , 2015 and 2014 , and ( iii ) critical accounting policies used in the preparation of the company 's consolidated financial statements . all dollar amounts are presented in thousands , except daily dollar amounts and per share amounts . general we are a provider of ocean transportation services for crude oil and refined petroleum products . we operate our vessels in the international flag market . our business includes two reportable segments : crude tankers and product carriers . for the years ended december 31 , 2016 , 2015 and 2014 we derived 67 % , 64 % and 66 % of our tce revenues from our crude tankers segment . revenues from our product carriers segment constituted the balance of our tce revenues for both periods . as of december 31 , 2016 , we owned or operated an international flag fleet of 55 vessels aggregating 6.5 million dwt and 864,800 cbm , including seven vessels that have been chartered-in under operating leases . our fleet includes ulcc , vlcc , aframax and panamax crude tankers and lr1 , lr2 and mr product carriers . through joint venture partnerships , we have ownership interests in two fso service vessels and four lng carriers ( together the “ jv vessels ” ) . other than the jv vessels , revenues are derived predominantly from spot market voyage charters and those vessels are predominantly employed in the spot market via market-leading commercial pools . we derived approximately 76 % , 90 % and 87 % of our total tce revenues in the spot market for the years ended december 31 , 2016 , 2015 and 2014 , respectively . our spin-off from overseas shipholding group , inc. on november 30 , 2016 , osg completed the separation of its business into two independent publicly-traded companies through the spin-off of insw . the spin-off transaction was in the form of a pro rata dividend of 100 % of the common stock of insw to holders of osg common stock and warrants . see note 1 “ basis of presentation and description of business , ” to the company 's consolidated financial statements set forth in item 8 , “ financial statements and supplementary data , ” for additional information relating to the spin-off transaction . operations and oil tanker markets the company 's revenues are highly sensitive to patterns of supply and demand for vessels of the size and design configurations owned and operated by the company and the trades in which those vessels operate . rates for the transportation of crude oil and refined petroleum products from which the company earns a substantial majority of its revenues are determined by market forces such as the supply and demand for oil , the distance that cargoes must be transported and the number of vessels expected to be available at the time such cargoes need to be transported . the demand for oil shipments is significantly affected by the state of the global economy levels of u.s. domestic and international production and opec exports . the number of vessels is affected by newbuilding deliveries and by the removal of existing vessels from service , principally through storage , scrappings or conversions . the company 's revenues are also affected by the mix of charters between spot ( voyage charter ) and long-term ( time or bareboat charter ) . because shipping revenues and voyage expenses are significantly affected by the mix between voyage charters and time charters , the company manages its vessels based on tce revenues . management makes economic decisions based on anticipated tce rates and evaluates financial performance based on tce rates achieved . the international energy agency ( “ iea ” ) estimates global oil consumption for the fourth quarter of 2016 at 96.9 million barrels per day ( “ b/d ” ) an increase of 1.3 million b/d , or 1.4 % , over the same quarter in 2015. the estimate for global oil consumption for all of 2016 is 96.3 million b/d , an increase of 1.4 % over 2015. oecd demand in 2016 is estimated to have increased by 0.4 % to 46.6 million b/d , while non-oecd demand is estimated to have increased by 2.5 % to 49.7 million b/d . global oil production in the fourth quarter of 2016 reached 97.0 million b/d , unchanged from the fourth quarter of 2015. opec crude oil production continued to achieve record levels averaging 33.1 million b/d in the fourth quarter of 2016 , an increase of 0.5 million b/d from the third quarter of 2016 , and 0.9 million b/d from the fourth quarter of 2015. non-opec production growth , decreased by 1.0 million b/d to 57.0 million b/d in the fourth quarter of 2016 compared with the fourth quarter of 2015. after declining from peak production in 2015 , oil production in the u.s. increased by 0.1 million b/d from 12.3 million b/d in the third quarter of 2016 to 12.4 million b/d in the fourth quarter of 2016 . story_separator_special_tag the decrease in revenue days reflected a contraction in the international crude tankers lightering fleet associated with reductions in the company 's full service international flag lightering business upon the expiry of its lightering contracts in september 2014. such reduction included the sales of two 1994-built aframaxes that had been utilized in the international flag lightering business , one in march 2014 and the second in september 2014 , and resulted in a reduction in tce revenue of $ 3,921 during 2015. also contributing to the decrease in revenue days were 1,289 fewer chartered-in days in the aframax fleet , as well as the company 's sale of a 1996-built vlcc , a 1997-built vlcc and a 2004-built panamax in december 2014 , and a 356-day increase in drydock and repair days in 2015 compared with 2014. vessel expenses increased by $ 6,903 to $ 86,174 in 2015 from $ 79,271 in 2014. the increase in vessel expenses reflects a reserve of $ 1,450 recorded in the third quarter of 2015 for an assessment by the mnrpf . the mnrpf is a multi-employer defined benefit pension plan covering british crew members that served onboard insw 's vessels ( as well as vessels of other owners ) more than 20 years ago . during 2014 the trustees of the mnrpf sought court approval for a new deficit reduction regime for participating employers . participating employers include current employers , historic employers that have made voluntary contributions , and historic employers such as insw that have made no deficit contributions . the trustees received court approval of the new deficit reduction regime in february 2015. although the company has not been an active member of the plan for a number of years , because the plan is underfunded , additional assessments are possible in future years . also contributing to the variance in vessel expenses were an increase of $ 1,670 in management fees paid to v.ships , and a $ 7,071 increase associated with the reactivation in the first quarter of 2015 of the ulcc discussed above and with one of the company 's panamaxes that had previously been bareboat chartered-out . such increases were partially offset by a 1,591-day decrease in owned and bareboat chartered-in vessels resulting from the fleet changes noted above . charter hire expenses decreased by $ 18,462 to $ 8,821 in 2015 from $ 27,283 in 2014 , resulting from a decrease of 1,945 chartered-in days in the current year , driven principally by the return of vessels discussed above . the only vessels in the segment that were time chartered-in by the company during 2015 were workboats employed in the international flag lightering business . 41 international seaways , inc. depreciation expense decreased by $ 4,933 to $ 51,347 in 2015 from $ 56,280 in 2014 , reflecting the 2014 vessel sales noted above . replace_table_token_7_th the following table provides a breakdown of tce rates achieved for the years ended december 31 , 2016 , 2015 and 2014 between spot and fixed earnings and the related revenue days . the information is based , in part , on information provided by the commercial pools in which certain of the segment 's vessels participate . replace_table_token_8_th during 2016 , tce revenues for the international product carriers segment decreased by $ 45,294 , or 26 % , to $ 126,314 from $ 171,608 in 2015. this decrease resulted primarily from a year-over-year decrease in average daily blended rates earned by the mr fleet , which accounted for $ 41,291 of the total decrease , and a 255-day decrease in mr fleet revenue days , which accounted for $ 4,667 of the total decrease . the reduction in revenue days was driven by the mr sale and redelivery discussed above . depreciation and amortization decreased by $ 2,067 to $ 26,696 in 2016 from $ 28,763 in 2015 , principally due to the impact of reductions in vessel bases that resulted from impairment charges on two vessels in the segment recorded in the third quarter of 2016 , and the mr sale in 2015 discussed above . during 2015 , tce revenues for the international product carriers segment increased by $ 52,939 , or 45 % , to $ 171,608 from $ 118,669 in 2014. approximately $ 48,927 of this increase in tce revenues resulted primarily from a significant year over year increase in average daily blended rates earned by the mr fleet . partially offsetting the stronger rates for the mr fleet was a $ 5,663 decrease associated with a 486-day decrease in mr fleet revenue days , primarily due to two time chartered-in vessels that were returned to their owners at the expiry of their charters . the delivery of a newbuilt lr2 in july 2014 also resulted in $ 9,198 of increased tce revenues during 2015 . 42 international seaways , inc. international product carriers segment vessel expenses increased by $ 3,407 to $ 58,118 in 2015 from $ 54,711 in 2014. such variance resulted from an increase of owned and bareboat chartered-in days of 52 days , primarily attributable to the lr2 delivery discussed above , partially offset by the sale of a 1998-built mr in july 2015. also contributing to the variance was an increase in average daily vessel expenses of $ 404 per day , which primarily related to management fees paid to v.ships , higher crew costs , and the timing of the delivery of stores and spares . charter hire expenses decreased by $ 5,698 to $ 27,981 in 2015 from $ 33,679 in 2014 reflecting 404 fewer chartered-in days in the mr fleet , as vessels were returned to their owners at the expiry of their charters . depreciation and amortization increased by $ 1,870 to $ 28,763 in 2015 from $ 26,893 in 2014 , principally due to $ 1,513 associated with the lr2 delivery discussed above .
","results from vessel operations during 2016 , income from vessel operations decreased by $ 170,373 to $ 5,941 from $ 176,314 in 2015. this decrease reflects the impact of declining tce revenues , net vessel impairment charges of $ 79,242 recorded in 2016 , and the incurrence of spin-off and severance related costs in 2016. such impacts were partially offset by a decrease in general and administrative expenses in the 2016 period . tce revenues decreased in 2016 by $ 90,745 , or 19 % , to $ 385,045 from $ 475,790 in 2015. the decrease was principally as a result of ( i ) a weakening in rates in the mr , vlcc and aframax sectors , which accounted for $ 106,558 of the overall decrease and ( ii ) a decrease in mr revenue days , which accounted for $ 4,667 of the overall decrease , and reflects the sale of a 1998-built mr in july 2015 as well as the redelivery of an mr to its owners at the expiry of its time charter in march 2015. these negative factors were partially offset by increased revenue days in the vlcc and aframax fleets due to fewer drydock and repair days , which accounted for a $ 11,623 increase in revenue , along with a $ 5,242 increase in revenue resulting from the company 's ulcc being taken out of lay-up in the first quarter of 2015. during 2015 , income from vessel operations improved by $ 171,710 to $ 176,314 from $ 4,604 in 2014. this increase reflects the impact of a significant strengthening of tce revenues , declining charter hire expense , and decreases in depreciation and amortization , severance and technical management transition costs and general and administrative expense .

story_separator_special_tag results of operations principal factors used in managing and evaluating our results of operations include return on average equity , net interest income , non-interest income , non-interest expense and net income . net interest income is affected by the level of interest rates , changes in interest rates and changes in the volume and composition of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities . the most significant impact on our net interest income between periods is derived from the interaction of changes in the rates earned or paid on interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities , which we refer to as interest rate spread . the volume of loans , investment securities and other interest earning assets , compared to the volume of interest bearing deposits and indebtedness , combined with the interest rate spread , produces changes in our net interest income between periods . non-interest bearing sources of funds , such as demand deposits and stockholders ' equity , also support earning assets . the impact of free funding sources is captured in the net interest margin , which is calculated as net interest income divided by average earning assets . we evaluate our net interest income on factors that include the yields on our loans and other earning assets , the costs of our deposits and other funding sources , the levels of our net interest spread and net interest margin . 34 we seek to increase our non-interest income over time and we evaluate our non-interest income relative to the trends of the individual types of non-interest income in view of prevailing market conditions . we manage our non-interest expenses in consideration of growth opportunities and our community banking model that emphasizes customer service and responsiveness . we evaluate our non-interest expense on factors that include our non-interest expense relative to our average assets , our efficiency ratio and the trends of the individual categories of non-interest expense . finally , we seek to increase our net income and provide favorable shareholder returns over time , and we evaluate our net income relative to the performance of other bank holding companies on factors that include return on average assets , return on average equity , total shareholder return and growth in earnings . financial condition principal areas of focus in managing and evaluating our financial condition include liquidity , the diversification and quality of our loans , the adequacy of our allowance for loan losses , the diversification and terms of our deposits and other funding sources , the re-pricing characteristics and maturities of our assets and liabilities , including potential interest rate exposure and the adequacy of our capital levels . we seek to maintain sufficient levels of cash and investment securities to meet potential payment and funding obligations , and we evaluate our liquidity on factors that include the levels of cash and highly liquid assets relative to our liabilities , the quality and maturities of our investment securities , the ratio of loans to deposits and any reliance on brokered certificates of deposit or other wholesale funding sources . we seek to maintain a diverse and high quality loan portfolio and evaluate our asset quality on factors that include the allocation of our loans among loan types , credit exposure to any single borrower or industry type , non-performing assets as a percentage of total loans and oreo , and loan charge-offs as a percentage of average loans . we seek to maintain our allowance for loan losses at a level adequate to absorb probable losses inherent in our loan portfolio at each balance sheet date , and we evaluate the level of our allowance for loan losses relative to our overall loan portfolio and the level of non-performing loans and potential charge-offs . we seek to fund our assets primarily using core customer deposits spread among various deposit categories , and we evaluate our deposit and funding mix on factors that include the allocation of our deposits among deposit types , the level of our non-interest bearing deposits , the ratio of our core deposits ( i.e . excluding time deposits above $ 100,000 ) to our total deposits and our reliance on brokered deposits or other wholesale funding sources , such as borrowings from other banks or agencies . we seek to manage the mix , maturities and re-pricing characteristics of our assets and liabilities to maintain relative stability of our net interest rate margin in a changing interest rate environment , and we evaluate our asset-liability management using models to evaluate the changes to our net interest income under different interest rate scenarios . finally , we seek to maintain adequate capital levels to absorb unforeseen operating losses and to help support the growth of our balance sheet . we evaluate our capital adequacy using the regulatory and financial capital ratios including leverage capital ratio , tier 1 risk-based capital ratio , total risk-based capital ratio , tangible common equity to tangible assets and tier 1 common capital to total risk-weighted assets . critical accounting estimates and significant accounting policies our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states and follow general practices within the industries in which we operate . application of these principles requires management to make estimates , assumptions and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes . our significant accounting policies are summarized in “ notes

"if impairment is indicated based on undiscounted expected future cash flows attributable to the property , then a provision for impairment is recognized to the extent that net capitalized costs exceed the estimated fair value of the property . the fair value is based upon estimated discounted future cash flows which are derived from level 3 inputs . expected future cash flows are determined using estimated future prices based on market based forward prices applied to projected future production volumes . costs are also projected to escalate at a rate that is based upon the company 's historical experience . the projected production volumes are based on the property 's proved and risk adjusted probable oil and natural gas reserve estimates at the end story_separator_special_tag the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our selected historical consolidated financial data and our accompanying consolidated financial statements and the notes to those financial statements included elsewhere in this report . the following discussion includes forward-looking statements that reflect our plans , estimates and beliefs . our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in these forward-looking statements . factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include , but are not limited to , those discussed below and elsewhere in this report , particularly in risk factors and cautionary note regarding forward-looking statements. overview we are an independent energy company engaged in the acquisition , exploration , development and production of oil and natural gas in the united states . we own interests in 1,643 producing oil and natural gas wells ( 914.5 net to us ) and we operate 962 of these wells . in managing our business , we are concerned primarily with maximizing return on our stockholders ' equity . to accomplish this goal , we focus on profitably increasing our oil and natural gas reserves and production . our future growth will be driven primarily by acquisition , development and exploration activities . in 2012 our growth in production and proved reserves was primarily driven by our successful oil focused drilling activities . under our current drilling budget , we plan to spend approximately $ 420.0 million in 2013 for development and exploration activities , which will primarily be focused on oil projects . we plan to drill 85 wells ( 58.1 net to us ) in 2013 , of which 75 wells ( 54.5 net to us ) will target oil in our south texas and west texas regions and ten will target natural gas in our east texas / north louisiana region . however , we could increase or decrease the number of wells that we drill depending on oil and natural gas prices . we do not specifically budget for acquisitions as the timing and size of acquisitions are not predictable . 44 we use the successful efforts method of accounting , which allows only for the capitalization of costs associated with developing proven oil and natural gas properties as well as exploration costs associated with successful exploration activities . accordingly , our exploration costs consist of costs we incur to acquire and reprocess 3-d seismic data , impairments of our unevaluated leasehold where we were not successful in discovering reserves and the costs of unsuccessful exploratory wells that we drill . we generally sell our oil and natural gas at current market prices at the point our wells connect to third party purchaser pipelines . we have entered into certain transportation and treating agreements with midstream and pipeline companies to transport a substantial portion of our natural gas production in north louisiana to long-haul gas pipelines . we market our products several different ways depending upon a number of factors , including the availability of purchasers for the product , the availability and cost of pipelines near our wells , market prices , pipeline constraints and operational flexibility . accordingly , our revenues are heavily dependent upon the prices of , and demand for , oil and natural gas . oil and natural gas prices have historically been volatile and are likely to remain volatile in the future . our operating costs are generally comprised of several components , including costs of field personnel , insurance , repair and maintenance costs , production supplies , fuel used in operations , transportation costs , workover expenses and state production and ad valorem taxes . like all oil and natural gas exploration and production companies , we face the constant challenge of replacing our reserves . although in the past we have offset the effect of declining production rates from existing properties through successful acquisition and drilling efforts , there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to offset production declines or maintain production at current rates through future acquisitions or drilling activity . our future growth will depend on our ability to continue to add new reserves in excess of production . our operations and facilities are subject to extensive federal , state and local laws and regulations relating to the exploration for , and the development , production and transportation of , oil and natural gas , and operating safety . future laws or regulations , any adverse changes in the interpretation of existing laws and regulations or our failure to comply with existing legal requirements may have an adverse effect on our business , results of operations and financial condition . applicable environmental regulations require us to remove our equipment after production has ceased , to plug and abandon our wells and to remediate any environmental damage our operations may have caused . the present value of the estimated future costs to plug and abandon our oil and gas wells and to dismantle and remove our production facilities is included in our reserve for future abandonment costs , which was $ 18.0 million as of december 31 , 2012 . 45 story_separator_special_tag font > our operating data for 2010 and 2011 is summarized below : replace_table_token_20_th ( 1 ) includes ad valorem taxes . story_separator_special_tag liquidity and capital resources funding for our activities has historically been provided by our operating cash flow , debt or equity financings and asset dispositions . our net cash provided by operating activities in 2012 totaled $ 262.2 million . our other primary sources of funds in 2012 included $ 285.9 million of net proceeds from a senior notes offering and $ 204.4 million from sales of assets . in 2011 , our net cash flow provided by operating activities totaled $ 284.9 million , while our other primary sources of funds included $ 293.4 million of net proceeds from a senior notes offering , $ 555.0 million of borrowings under our bank credit facility and $ 53.4 million of proceeds from sales of marketable securities . in 2010 , our net cash flow provided by operating activities from continuing operations totaled $ 311.7 million . our other primary source of funds in 2010 was $ 96.9 million of net proceeds from sales of oil and gas properties and marketable securities and $ 45.0 million of borrowings under our bank credit facility . our cash flow from operating activities in 2012 of $ 262.2 million represented a decrease of $ 22.7 million from our cash from operating activities of $ 284.9 million in 2011. cash flow from 49 operations excluding changes in working capital accounts of $ 261.3 million in 2012 decreased by $ 36.3 million or 12 % as compared to $ 297.6 million in 2011 due to the lower revenues we received because of the decline in natural gas prices during 2012 which was partially offset by higher oil production . our cash flow from operating activities in 2011 decreased by $ 26.8 million to $ 284.9 million as compared to $ 311.7 million in 2010 primarily due to changes in working capital at the end of 2011. our primary need for capital , in addition to funding our ongoing operations , relates to the acquisition , development and exploration of our oil and gas properties and the repayment of our debt . during 2012 our capital expenditures of $ 550.6 million decreased by $ 497.1 million as compared to 2011 capital expenditures of $ 1.0 billion due primarily to the acquisitions of proved and unproved properties we made in 2011. capital expenditures in 2012 include $ 70.9 million spent to complete wells drilled in 2011. in 2011 , our capital expenditures of $ 1.0 billion increased by $ 502.0 million as compared to 2010 capital expenditures of $ 545.7 million , mainly due to the acquisition of oil and gas properties in 2011. our annual capital expenditure activity is summarized in the following table : replace_table_token_21_th ( 1 ) excludes reimbursements from joint venture partner for preformation well costs of $ 23.8 million . the timing of most of our capital expenditures is discretionary because we have no material long-term capital expenditure commitments except for contracted drilling and completion services . consequently , we have a significant degree of flexibility to adjust the level of our capital expenditures as circumstances warrant . we currently expect to spend approximately $ 445.0 million for development and exploration projects and lease acquisitions in 2013 , which will be funded primarily by cash flows from operating activities , proceeds from asset sales and borrowings under our credit facility . our operating cash flow and , therefore , our capital expenditures are highly dependent on oil and natural gas prices and , in particular , natural gas prices . we do not have a specific acquisition budget for 2013 because the timing and size of acquisitions are unpredictable . smaller acquisitions will generally be funded from operating cash flow . with respect to significant acquisitions , we intend to use borrowings under our bank credit facility , or other debt or equity financings to the extent available , to finance such acquisitions . the availability and attractiveness of these sources of financing will depend upon a number of factors , some of which will relate to our financial condition and performance and some of which will be beyond our control , such as prevailing interest rates , oil and natural gas prices and other market conditions . lack of access to the debt or equity markets due to general economic conditions could impede our ability to complete acquisitions . we have a $ 850.0 million bank credit facility with bank of montreal , as the administrative agent . the bank credit facility is a five-year revolving credit commitment that matures on november 30 , 2015 . 50 indebtedness under the bank credit facility is secured by all of our and our wholly owned subsidiaries ' assets and is guaranteed by all of our wholly owned subsidiaries . the bank credit facility is subject to borrowing base availability , which is redetermined semiannually based on the banks ' estimates of the future net cash flows of our oil and natural gas properties . as of december 31 , 2012 , the borrowing base was $ 570.0 million , $ 130.0 million of which was available . the borrowing base may be affected by the performance of our properties and changes in oil and natural gas prices . the determination of the borrowing base is at the sole discretion of the administrative agent and the bank group . borrowings under the bank credit facility bear interest , based on the utilization of the borrowing base , at our option at either ( 1 ) libor plus 1.75 % to 2.75 % or ( 2 ) the base rate ( which is the higher of the administrative agent 's prime rate , the federal funds rate plus 0.5 % or 30 day libor plus 1.0 % ) plus 0.75 % to 1.75 % . a commitment fee of 0.5 % is payable on the unused borrowing base .

"the constant-currency amounts are calculated by translating the current year 's functional currency results at the prior-year period 's exchange rate . we may also refer to consolidated operating profit and consolidated operating profit margin excluding the effects of unallocated items . the re-measured results excluding effects from currency translation and excluding the effects of unallocated items are not in conformity with u.s. gaap and should not be used as a substitute for the comparable u.s. gaap financial measures . the non-u.s. gaap financial measures are incorporated into our discussion and analysis as management uses them in evaluating our results of operations , and believes that this information provides users a valuable insight into our results . our operations we are a manufacturer of packaging components and delivery systems for injectable drugs and healthcare products . our products include vial containment solutions , prefillable systems , self-injection platforms , cartridge systems and components , reconstitution and transfer systems , intradermal delivery solutions , specialty components , and contract manufacturing and analytical services . our customers include the leading biologic , generic , pharmaceutical , diagnostic , and medical device companies in the world . the company was incorporated under the laws of the commonwealth of pennsylvania on july 27 , 1923. in 2015 , our business operations consisted of two reportable segments , packaging systems and delivery systems . beginning in 2016 , we changed our organization and reporting structure for our next phase of growth and development , which resulted in a change to proprietary products and contract-manufactured products as our reportable segments . our proprietary products reportable segment , which is a combination of the previous packaging systems segment and the proprietary products portion of the previous delivery systems segment , develops commercial , operational , and innovation strategies across our global network , with specific emphasis on product offerings to biologic , generic , and pharmaceutical drug customers . our contract-manufactured products reportable segment , which consists of the contract manufacturing portion of the previous delivery systems segment , serves as a fully integrated business focused on the design , manufacture , and automated assembly of complex devices , primarily for pharmaceutical , diagnostic , and medical device customers . we also maintain global partnerships to share technologies and market products with affiliates in japan and mexico . as a result of our global manufacturing and distribution presence , more than half of our revenues are generated outside of the u.s. in currencies other than usd , including approximately 40 % in europe and 10 % collectively in asia and south america . fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates , therefore , can have a significant effect on our consolidated financial results . generally , our financial results are affected positively by a weaker usd and negatively by a stronger usd , as compared to the foreign currencies in which we conduct our business . in terms of net sales , the most significant foreign currencies are the euro , the singapore dollar , and the danish krone , with euro-denominated sales representing the majority of sales transacted in foreign currencies . in addition , we are 23 exposed to yen , as we maintain a 25 % ownership interest in , and we purchase finished goods and other materials from , daikyo . we are also exposed to currencies in emerging market countries , such as the chinese yuan , the indian rupee , and various south american currencies , including the venezuelan bolivar and the argentinian peso , both of which were unfavorable to our results in 2016. during 2016 , average exchange rates were unfavorable versus the exchange rates realized in 2015. foreign currency translation resulted in lower reported net sales , operating profit , net income , and net income per diluted share of $ 17.5 million , $ 4.0 million , $ 2.9 million , and $ 0.04 , respectively , as compared to 2015. segment results presented in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and related notes have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the impact of this

increased by $ 45.3 million , or 9.9 % , in 2016 , as product mix improvements , production efficiencies , and sales price increases were partially offset by increased labor and overhead costs . consolidated gross profit margin increased by 0.6 margin points in 2016. net income per diluted share was $ 1.91 in 2016 , as compared to $ 1.30 in 2015. results for 2016 included restructuring and related charges , a charge related to the devaluation of the venezuelan bolivar , the impact of foreign currency translation , and a discrete tax charge , which reduced net income per diluted share by $ 0.23 , $ 0.04 , $ 0.04 , and $ 0.01 , respectively , as compared to 2015. results for 2016 also included a pension curtailment gain , which increased net income per diluted share by $ 0.01 , as

"other-than-temporary impairment ( `` otti `` ) unrealized losses for all investment securities are reviewed to determine whether story_separator_special_tag introduction we are a bank holding company that , through our banking subsidiary , central pacific bank , offers full service commercial banking in the state of hawaii . we strive to provide exceptional customer service and products that meet our customers ' needs . our products and services consist primarily of the following : loans : our loans consist of commercial , commercial mortgage , and construction loans to small and medium-sized companies , business professionals , and real estate investors and developers , as well and residential mortgage and consumer loans to local homeowners and individuals . our lending activities contribute to a key component of our revenues reported in interest income . deposits : we offer a full range of deposit products and services including checking , savings and time deposits , cash management , and electronic banking services . we also maintain a broad branch and atm network in the state of hawaii . the interest paid on such deposits has a significant impact on our interest expense , an important factor in determining our earnings . in addition , fees and service charges on deposit accounts contribute to our revenues . additionally , we offer wealth management products and services , such as non-deposit investment products , annuities , insurance , investment management , asset custody and general consultation and planning services . executive overview in 2016 we continued to achieve key objectives for the company . we recorded our sixth consecutive profitable year in 2016 with net income of $ 47.0 million , or $ 1.50 per diluted common share . we saw continued improvement in our asset quality as our nonperforming assets decline d by $ 7.0 million to $ 9.2 million at december 31 , 2016 from $ 16.2 million at december 31 , 2015 . as a result of the continued improvement in our credit risk profile , we were able to further reduce our allowance for loan and lease losses ( the `` allowance '' ) , which again resulted in a positive impact to earnings . our total provision for loan and lease losses ( the `` provision '' ) was a credit of $ 5.5 million , compared to a credit of $ 15.7 million in 2015 . with the improving market conditions in hawaii , together with our efforts to expand and strengthen customer relationships , we realized strong loan growth of $ 313.4 million , or 9.8 % , as well as an increase of $ 131.4 million , or 3.7 % in our core deposit base in 2016 . our capital position remained strong , supported by six consecutive years of profitability and the improvements in our asset quality . with consistent profitability , we were able to increase our regular cash dividends paid from $ 0.50 per share in 2015 to $ 0.60 per share in 2016 . in december 2015 , we also paid a special cash dividend of $ 0.32 per share . in 2016 , our strong capital position and consistent profitability also allowed us to execute on our stock buyback program and repurchase 796,822 shares , or approximately 2.5 % of outstanding shares as of december 31 , 2015 . basis of presentation management 's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements under `` part ii , item 8. financial statements and supplementary data . '' business environment while the u.s. economy is in its 7th year of recovery following the downturn , there is continued uncertainty in the u.s. and global macroeconomic environments . job gains have been moderate and wages have not increased significantly , while inflation has remained below the federal reserve 's long term objective and business fixed investment remains low . furthermore . the 33 policy actions of the new u.s. presidential administration also add further uncertainty to the economic and regulatory environment until policy details are solidified . the majority of our operations are concentrated in the state of hawaii . as a result , our performance is significantly influenced by the real estate markets and economic environment in hawaii . macroeconomic conditions also influence our performance . a favorable business environment is generally characterized by expanding gross state product , low unemployment and rising personal income ; while an unfavorable business environment is characterized by the reverse . hawaii 's general economic conditions continued to improve in 2016 . tourism continues to be hawaii 's center of strength and its most significant economic driver . for the fifth straight year , hawaii 's strong visitor industry broke records for visitor arrivals and visitor spending . according to the hawaii tourism authority ( `` hta '' ) , 8.9 million total visitors arrived in the state in 2016 . this was an increase of 3.0 % from the previous high of 8.7 million visitor arrivals in 2015 . the hta also reported that total spending by visitors increased to $ 15.61 billion in 2016 , an increase of 4.2 % , from the previous high of $ 14.98 billion in 2015 . according to the hawaii department of business economic development & tourism ( `` dbedt '' ) , total visitor arrivals and visitor spending are expected to gain 1.8 % and 4.0 % in 2017 , respectively . hawaii 's labor market conditions also continued to improve in 2016 . the department of labor and industrial relations reported that hawaii 's seasonally adjusted annual unemployment rate improved to 2.9 % in december 2016 , compared to 3.3 % in december 2015. the last time the seasonally adjusted annual unemployment rate was at 2.9 % was in september 2007. in addition , hawaii 's unemployment rate in december 2016 of 2.9 % , which is among the lowest in the nation , remained below the national seasonally adjusted unemployment rate of 4.7 % . story_separator_special_tag if the valuation of the impaired loan is less than the recorded investment in the loan , the deficiency will be charged off against the allowance or , alternatively , a specific reserve will be established and included in the overall allowance balance . the company did not record a specific reserve as of december 31 , 2016 , compared to $ 51 thousand at december 31 , 2015 . general allowance in determining the general allowance component of the allowance , the company utilizes a comprehensive approach to segment the loan portfolio into homogenous groups . the enhanced methodology segments the portfolio by fdic call report codes . this results in nine segments , and is more consistent with industry practice . for the purpose of determining general allowance loss factors , loss experience is derived from a migration analysis , with the exception of national syndicated loans where an average historical loss rate is applied due to limited historical loss experience . the key inputs to run a migration analysis are the length of the migration period , the dates for the migration periods to start and the number of migration periods used for the analysis . for each migration period , the analysis will determine the outstanding balance in each segment and or sub-segment at the start of each period . these loans will then be followed for the length of the migration period to identify the amount of associated charge-offs and recoveries . a loss rate for each migration period is calculated using the formula ‘ net charge-offs over the period divided by beginning loan balance ' . the allowance methodology applies a look back period to january 1 , 2010. the company intends to extend its look back period moving forward . qualitative adjustments our allowance methodology uses qualitative adjustments to address changes in conditions , trends , and circumstances such as economic conditions and industry changes that could have a significant impact on the risk profile of the loan portfolio , and provide for losses in the loan portfolio that may not be reflected and or captured in the historical loss data . in order to ensure that the qualitative adjustments are in compliance with current regulatory standards and u.s. gaap , the company is primarily 35 basing adjustments on the nine standard factors outlined in the frb 's 2006 interagency policy statement on the allowance for loan and lease losses . these factors include : lending policies , economic conditions , loan profile , lending staff , problem loan trends , loan review , collateral , credit concentrations and other internal & external factors . in recognizing that current and relevant environmental ( economic , market or other ) conditions that can affect repayment may not yet be fully reflected in historical loss experience , qualitative adjustments are applied to factor in current loan portfolio and market intelligence . these adjustments , which are added to the historical loss rate , consider the nature of the company 's primary markets and are reasonable , consistently determined and appropriately documented . management reviews the results of the qualitative adjustment quarterly to ensure it is consistent with the trends in the overall economy , and from time to time may make adjustments , if necessary , to ensure directional consistency . loans held for sale loans held for sale consists of the following two types : ( 1 ) hawaii residential mortgage loans that are originated with the intent to sell them in the secondary market and ( 2 ) non-residential mortgage loans in both hawaii and the u.s. mainland that were originated with the intent to be held in our portfolio but were subsequently transferred to the held for sale category . hawaii residential mortgage loans classified as held for sale are carried at the lower of cost or fair value on an aggregate basis while the non-residential hawaii and u.s. mainland loans are recorded at the lower of cost or fair value on an individual basis . when a non-residential mortgage loan is transferred to the held for sale category , the loan is recorded at the lower of cost or fair value . any reduction in the loan 's value is reflected as a write-down of the recorded investment resulting in a new cost basis , with a corresponding reduction in the allowance . in subsequent periods , if the fair value of a loan classified as held for sale is less than its cost basis , a valuation adjustment is recognized in our consolidated statement of income in other operating expense and the carrying value of the loan is adjusted accordingly . the valuation adjustment may be recovered in the event that the fair value increases , which is also recognized in our consolidated statement of income in other operating expense . the fair value of loans classified as held for sale are generally based upon quoted prices for similar assets in active markets , acceptance of firm offer letters with agreed upon purchase prices , discounted cash flow models that take into account market observable assumptions , or independent appraisals of the underlying collateral securing the loans . we report the fair values of the non-residential mortgage loans classified as held for sale net of applicable selling costs on our consolidated balance sheets . as of december 31 , 2016 and 2015 , all of our loans held for sale were hawaii residential mortgage loans . mortgage servicing rights we utilize the amortization method to measure our mortgage servicing rights . under the amortization method , we amortize our mortgage servicing rights in proportion to and over the period of net servicing income . income generated as a result of new mortgage servicing rights is reported as gains on sales of loans . amortization of the servicing rights is reported as a component of mortgage banking income in the other operating income section of our consolidated statements of income . ancillary income is recorded in other income .
","overview of results of operations 2016 vs. 2015 comparison in 2016 , we recognized net income of $ 47.0 million , or $ 1.50 per diluted common share , compared to net income of $ 45.9 million , or $ 1.40 per diluted common share , in 2015 . we recorded a credit to the provision of $ 5.5 million in 2016 , compared to $ 15.7 million in 2015 . net interest income increase d by $ 8.4 million from 2015 to 2016 , primarily due to a significant increase in average loans and leases , partially offset by lower yields earned on loans and leases and taxable investment securities , combined with higher rates paid on time deposits $ 100,000 and over . other operating income increase d by $ 7.5 million from 2015 to 2016 . the increase in other operating income was due primarily to a $ 3.5 million gain on the sale of the company 's fee interest in a former branch location in 2016 , combined with investment securities losses of $ 1.9 million recorded in 2015. in addition , we recorded higher mortgage banking income of $ 0.8 million and higher income from bank-owned life insurance of $ 0.7 million in 2016 compared to 2015. other operating expense increase d by $ 6.5 million , primarily due to the increase in salaries and employee benefits of $ 7.1 million in 2016 compared to 2015. the higher salaries and employee benefits is primarily due to higher pension expense in 2016 of $ 4.2 million , combined with the one-time reversal of an accrual in the second quarter of 2015 of $ 2.4 million for a former executive officer 's retirement benefits which will not be paid .

inception . we do not have sufficient cash to fund normal operations and meet debt obligations for the next 12 months without deferring payment on certain current liabilities and raising additional funds . we believe that the going concern condition can not be removed with confidence until the company has entered into a business climate where funding of its activities is more assured . we currently have only a brief , recent history of a recurring source of revenue and in 2016 received our first cash distribution from the joint venture . if we profitably execute a production business plan , our ability to continue as a going concern may improve and become less dependent on our ability to raise capital to fund our future exploration and working capital requirements . our plans for the long-term include the profitable exploitation of our mining properties and financing our future operations through sales of our common stock and or debt . additionally , the capital markets and general economic conditions in the united states are constantly changing and may present significant obstacles to raising the required funds . these factors raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern . during the year ended december 31 , 2020 , we completed financings of $ 904,600 , compared to $ 888,000 net cash for note financings and placements of our securities

obligation to update these forward-looking statements after the date of this report to reflect future events or circumstances or to reflect actual outcomes . the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements of staar , including the related notes , provided in this report . overview strategy staar 's strategy is to be valued as a leading global provider of innovative intraocular lens system technologies . staar employs a commercialization strategy that focuses on achieving sustainable profitable growth . performance against 2011 key operational metrics two principal strategic goals guided staar 's key operational metrics in 2011 : to achieve and maintain profitability and to lay the groundwork for further growth . in pursuit of these goals , staar aligned its business initiatives during 2011 along four key operational metrics that it used to gauge its success during the year . based on performance in excess of targets during the second quarter , staar increased the targets for three of the four metrics , and in final form they are as follows : · increase total revenue by double digits . · grow visian icl and ticl sales by 30 % . · continuously increase gross profit margin each quarter to achieve a level of 66.5 % for the full year . · achieve profitability in all four quarters of 2011. as detailed below , staar satisfied all four of the metrics during 2011. increase total revenue by double digits . by placing less emphasis on less profitable non-core products , staar has both increased its revenue and increased the portion of its revenue derived from h igher value core products . staar set a target of double digit growth in total revenue during 2011. staar achieved 13.9 % growth in the fourth quarter of 2011 and 14.2 % growth for the year . grow visian icl and ticl sales by 30 % . staar achieved 37 % growth rate in visian icl and ticl sales in the fourth quarter of 2011 and a 32 % growth rate for the year . we have been pursuing the goal of increased icl and ticl sales by identifying the top ten markets and concentrating our sales and marketing efforts on increasing our market share in those regions . growth rates in the top ten markets on which we currently focus were 45 % for the fourth quarter and 35 % for the year . staar launched its new visian v4c with centraflow technology in the countries covered by the ce mark late in the fourth quarter of 2011. u.s. icl sales have continued a trend of relatively slow growth seen over the last two years , growing at 2 % for the year . early in 2011 we had set an original goal to increase visian icl and ticl sales by 25 % ; we increased the goal after exceeding the target level in the second quarter . because visian products are used in elective surgery , the rate of sales growth depends on continued improvement in global economic conditions . we discuss recent trends in visian sales in greater detail below under the heading visian icl and ticl sales . 29 continuously expand gross profit margin each quarter to achieve a level of 66.5 % for the full year . staar 's gross profit margin was 69.8 % in the fourth quarter and 67.5 % for the year . the biggest factor in the improving margins has been the change in our product mix . visian products yield a significantly higher profit margin than iols . and among iols , staar has increased average selling prices by emphasizing sales of its higher value iols , such as nanoflex and our toric iol . preloaded iol sales in some territories , especially japan , have historically yielded good profit margins and their sales increased 5 % during 2011. since 2009 staar has de-emphasized lower margin sales of non-iol , non-icl products . based on performance in the first half of 2011 , staar raised its gross profit margin target to 66.5 % for the full year from an initial target of 66 % at year end . staar believes it can continue to improve its profit margins through further emphasis on high value products , through cost reductions from its manufacturing consolidation plan , and potentially through economies of scale if unit volumes of higher value products increase . achieve profitability in all four quarters of 2011. staar achieved net earnings of $ 1.3 million in 2011 , or $ 0.04 per share . in the fourth quarter staar achieved net earnings of $ 0.1 million , or $ 0.00 per share . story_separator_special_tag sales in the private sector continued to increase , up by 24.2 % in the quarter and were up 12.8 % for the year . sales to the military declined by 31.3 % in the quarter bringing the year to date decline to 35.8 % . military sales accounted for 14.7 % of total us icl sales during 2011 , compared to 23.3 % in 2010. staar believes the increase in private sector sales resulted from its efforts to drive greater adoption and increased usage of the lower diopter range among its existing customer base . if the economy continues to improve , and overall refractive procedures volume increases , staar could see further growth in private sector icl sales in the u.s. beginning the fourth quarter of 2010 staar has been testing direct-to-consumer advertising initiatives online and has used conventional direct-to-consumer media to test a campaign in selected markets . this activity seeks to increase potential refractive patient visits and to encourage patients to inquire specifically about the visian icl by distinguishing it from other refractive treatments . the current materials for the campaign are a series of humorous videos contrasting the visian icl with lasik , eyeglasses and contact lenses . the videos highlight certain benefits of the icl over other treatments , including clarity of vision , absence of surgically induced dry eye , removability and ultraviolet protection . staar is assessing the data obtained to date to determine whether , and in what form , to launch a broader direct-to-consumer campaign additionally , staar has begun efforts to increase the visibility of the visian icl technology on social network sites . contestants developed videos in which they tried to convince voters why they needed a free visian icl procedure . staar worked with nine ophthalmic practices across the u.s. , and five winners were determined based on consumer voting on the network . in most cases the winners ' visian icl procedures attracted favorable local media attention . during the october 2011 american academy of ophthalmology meeting , staar offered online marketing consulting for key practices to support their viral efforts around the visian icl technology . staar has decided to expand its social networking department in 2012 in order to more effectively drive consumer testimonials and respond to consumer questions . global iol sales . staar pioneered the development of folding lenses for use in cataract surgery , and iols continue to represent approximately 44 % of staar 's business . sales of iols during the three months and year ended december 30 , 2011 were $ 6.8 million and $ 27.5 million , compared to $ 7.1 million and $ 27.5 million for the same periods in the prior year . in september 2011 , staar launched its nanoflex collamer single piece iol which can be injected through a 2.2 mm incision with the nanopoint injector system , in the territories that recognize the ce mark . staar received ce mark approval to market its nanoflex toric iol in november 2011 , and expects to begin marketing the lens during the first half of 2012. nanoflex is staar 's largest selling iol product in u.s. markets and staar believes the lens can receive broad commercial acceptance outside the u.s. staar hopes that the biocompatibility and outstanding optical properties of collamer , with which surgeons have become acquainted through the icl , will build interest in the nanoflex iol worldwide . availability of the toric version of the lens , which corrects pre-existing astigmatism at the time of cataract surgery , is expected to increase interest in the nanoflex technology . staar 's collamer accommodating study team ( cast ) has reported promising assessments regarding initial intermediate and near vision results with the nanoflex lens . these properties of nanoflex may also spur interest in the lens in new markets , especially among surgeons seeking an iol for monovision treatment . 31 staar has marketed its silicone toric iol since 1998 and believes that the addition of the nanoflex toric will make the product line more competitive with acrylic toric iols now in the market . among other things , the nanoflex toric features an aspheric optic , and we believe the bioadhesive nature of the collamer material will provide excellent rotational stability , a key characteristic for toric lenses . among staar 's initiatives to grow its iol business are the following : · we plan to seek further approvals for the nanoflex and nanoflex toric in an effort to build a global product franchise for collamer iols ; · a new version of the hydrophobic acrylic preloaded injector , featuring the popular single-piece iol format , received ce mark approval in may 2011 , and staar plans to introduce it into international markets in 2012 ; · we plan to introduce a preloaded injector for the nanoflex and nanoflex toric ; · we have recently seen renewed interest in our silicone toric iol among u.s. surgeons and are ramping up marketing efforts for the lens ; and · we are seeking approval to introduce the silicone preloaded injector in the u.s. market to enhance our u.s. iol offering and help staar maintain or increase its market share in the hospital-based segment ; · we are researching accommodating and or multifocal designs that exploit the unique optical properties of the collamer material . staar cautions that the successful development and introduction of new products is subject to risks and uncertainties , including the risk of unexpected delays and , in some cases , approval of regulatory authorities . manufacturing consolidation project and tax strategy . during 2011 staar devoted significant resources to two initiatives : a project to consolidate global manufacturing , and development of a strategy to optimize our global organization for tax purposes . the goal of both of these strategies is to continue our improvement in gross profit margin by reducing costs and to position the company for future growth . staar currently manufactures its products in four facilities worldwide .
","results of operations the following table sets forth the percentage of total sales represented by certain items reflected in the company 's consolidated statement of operations for the period indicated and the percentage increase or decrease in such items over the prior period . replace_table_token_4_th * denotes change is greater than 100 % the following table presents our net sales , by product , for the fiscal years presented ( dollars in thousands ) : replace_table_token_5_th net sales for 2011 were $ 62.8 million , a 14.2 % increase over the $ 55.0 million reported in fiscal 2010. the increase in net sales was due to 15 % increase in our core product sales ( iol and icl ) . core products represented 95.0 % and 94.3 % of the company 's total sales in fiscal year 2011 and 2010 , respectively . changes in foreign currency favorably impacted our net sales in 2011 by $ 1.7 million . 34 net sales for 2010 were $ 55.0 million , a 7.6 % increase over the $ 51.1 million reported in fiscal 2009. the increase in net sales was due to 10 % increase in our core product sales ( iol and icl ) . core products represented 94.3 % and 92.7 % of the company 's total sales in fiscal 2010 and 2009 , respectively . changes in foreign currency favorably impacted our net sales in 2010 by $ 1.2 million . total iol sales were $ 27.5 million for fiscal 2011 and 2010 , respectively . increased sales of preloaded acrylic iols in china and germany and toric iols in the u.s. were offset by decreased collamer and silicone iol sales . although iol sales were essentially flat year over year , iol margins were up 3 % due to improved average selling prices , costs , and geographic mix . as an example , sales of our largest selling iol , the preloaded silicone iol , were down 1 % year over year .

year ended december 31 , 2019 , filed with the u.s. securities and exchange commission on february 26 , 2020. basis of presentation in april 2019 , we acquired from our sponsor all of the class b units of enviva wilmington holdings , llc ( the “ hamlet jv , ” and such acquisition , the “ hamlet drop-down ” ) . the hamlet jv owns a wood pellet production plant in hamlet , north carolina ( the “ hamlet plant ” ) . we are the managing member of the hamlet jv , which is partially owned by john hancock life insurance company ( u.s.a. ) and certain of its affiliates ( collectively , where applicable , “ john hancock ” ) . we accounted for the hamlet jv as a consolidated subsidiary , not as a joint venture , following the hamlet drop-down . for more information regarding our rights and obligations with respect to the hamlet jv , see note 17 , partners ' capital-hamlet jv . business overview we are a delaware limited partnership formed in 2013 to aggregate a natural resource , wood fiber and process it into a transportable form , wood pellets . we sell a significant majority of our wood pellets through long-term , take-or-pay off-take contracts with creditworthy customers in the united kingdom , europe and increasingly in japan . we own and operate nine plants ( collectively , “ our plants ” ) with a combined production capacity of approximately 5.3 million metric tons ( “ mt ” ) of wood pellets per year ( “ mtpy ” ) in virginia , north carolina , south carolina , georgia , florida and mississippi , the production of which is fully contracted through 2025. we export wood pellets through our wholly owned dry-bulk , deep-water marine terminal at the port of chesapeake , virginia ( the “ chesapeake terminal ” ) and terminal assets at the port of wilmington , north carolina ( the “ wilmington terminal ” ) and from third-party deep-water marine terminals in savannah , georgia ( the “ savannah terminal ” ) , mobile , alabama ( the “ mobile terminal ” ) and panama city , florida ( the “ panama city terminal ” ) . all of our facilities are located in geographic regions with low input costs and favorable transportation logistics . owning these cost-advantaged assets , the output from which is fully contracted through 2025 , in a rapidly expanding industry provides us with a platform to generate stable and growing cash flows . our plants are sited in robust fiber baskets providing stable pricing for the low-grade fiber used to produce wood pellets . our raw materials are byproducts of traditional timber harvesting , principally low-value wood materials , such as trees generally not suited for sawmilling or other manufactured forest products , and tree tops and limbs , understory , brush and slash that are generated in a harvest . our strategy is to fully contract the wood pellet production from our plants under long-term , take-or-pay off-take contracts with a diversified and creditworthy customer base . our long-term off-take contracts typically provide for fixed-price deliveries that may include provisions that escalate the price over time and provide for other margin protection . during 2020 , production capacity from our wood pellet production plants and wood pellets sourced from our affiliates and third parties were approximately equal to the contracted volumes under our existing long-term , take-or-pay off-take contracts . our long-term , take-or-pay off-take contracts provide for a product sales backlog of $ 14.6 billion and have a total weighted-average remaining term of 12.8 years from february 1 , 2021. under our current product sales backlog , our plants are fully contracted through 2025. assuming all volumes under the firm and contingent long-term off-take contracts held by our sponsor were included with our product sales backlog for firm and contingent contracted product sales , our product sales backlog would increase to $ 19.9 billion and the total weighted-average remaining term from february 1 , 2021 would increase to 14.0 years . our customers use our wood pellets as a substitute fuel for coal in dedicated biomass or co-fired coal power plants . wood pellets serve as a suitable “ drop-in ” alternative to coal because of their comparable heat content , density and form . due to the 39 uninterruptible nature of our customers ' fuel consumption , our customers require a reliable supply of wood pellets that meet stringent product specifications . we have built our operations and assets to deliver and certify the highest levels of product quality and our proven track record of reliable deliveries enables us to charge premium prices for this certainty . in addition to our customers ' focus on the reliability of supply , they are concerned about the combustion efficiency of the wood pellets and their safe handling . because combustion efficiency is a function of energy density , particle size distribution , ash/inert content and moisture , our customers require that we supply wood pellets meeting minimum criteria for a variety of specifications and , in some cases , provide incentives for exceeding our contract specifications . story_separator_special_tag on july 10 , 2020 , we filed the shelf registration statement and on july 20 , 2020 , the shelf registration statement was declared effective . financing activities our net proceeds of $ 190.8 million from the private placement and the net proceeds of the tack-on offering of the 2026 notes of $ 153.6 million were used primarily to pay for the $ 129.7 million purchase price for the greenwood drop-down , and to pay $ 164.8 million of the purchase price for the georgia biomass acquisition . mid-atlantic expansions during 2019 , we started construction to increase the aggregate wood pellet production capacity of our plants in northampton , north carolina ( the “ northampton plant ” ) , and southampton , virginia ( the “ southampton plant ” ) ( together , the “ mid-atlantic expansions ” ) by approximately 400,000 mtpy . in 2021 , we completed the construction of the mid-atlantic expansions and are in the process of ramping the expansions . as of december 31 , 2020 , we have paid approximately $ 120.0 million , and expect to pay approximately $ 10.0 million during 2021 , in connection with the expansions . commitment to achieve carbon-neutral operations consistent with our mission to displace coal , grow more trees and fight climate change , we and our sponsor recently announced our commitment to become “ net-zero ” in ghg emissions from our operations by 2030. the product we manufacture helps reduce the lifecycle ghg emissions of our customers , but we believe we must also do our part within our operations to mitigate the impacts of climate change . we expect to accomplish neutrality with respect to our scope 1 emissions ( i.e. , direct emissions from our manufacturing ) by improving energy efficiency and adopting lower-carbon processes , as well as through investment in carbon offsets . we also plan to neutralize our scope 2 emissions ( i.e. , indirect emissions from energy we purchase ) by using 100 % renewable energy by 2030 through the purchase of renewable electricity and or onsite generation where practicable . moreover , we will seek to proactively engage with our suppliers , transportation partners and other stakeholders to drive innovative improvements in our supply chain to reduce our scope 3 emissions ( i.e. , indirect emissions in our value chain ) . we intend to report our scopes 1 , 2 and 3 emissions annually and fully meet the requirements of cdp ( formerly known as the carbon disclosure project ) by 2022. although it is difficult to project the incremental cost to our operations in 2030 , we do not expect any material impact to our financial performance as a result of our efforts to achieve “ net-zero ” in ghg emissions from our operations . outbreak of the novel coronavirus the outbreak of a novel strain of coronavirus ( “ covid-19 ” ) has significantly adversely impacted global markets and continues to present global public health and economic challenges . although the full impact of covid-19 is unknown and rapidly evolving , to date , our operations have not been materially impacted by the outbreak . we have taken prescriptive safety measures including social distancing , hygienic policies and procedures and other steps recommended by the centers for disease control and prevention ( the “ cdc ” ) , and adopted the cdc 's risk management approach , since the beginning of the outbreak , and have established risk levels based on the degree to which the virus has spread in a given community and the nature of the work performed at that location . within our field operations , we have continued operations largely as normal with the additional precautionary measures ; however , we continue to monitor local data 41 on a daily basis and have prioritized putting the right plans , procedures and measures in place to mitigate the risk of exposure and infection and the related impacts to our business . we specifically designed our operations and logistics systems with flexibility and redundancies so they are capable of effectively responding to unforeseen events . we operate a portfolio of nine wood pellet production plants geographically dispersed across the southeast u.s. we export our product from a portfolio of five bulk terminals and transport it to our customers under long-term , fixed-price shipping contracts with multiple shipping partners . these operations currently are unaffected by covid-19 . in march 2020 , the united states declared the covid-19 pandemic a national emergency , and several states and municipalities , including states in which we own assets or conduct business , have declared public health emergencies and taken extraordinary actions in response , including issuing “ stay-at-home ” orders and similar mandates ( “ orders ” ) for many businesses to curtail or cease normal operations . to date , we have not been materially impacted by the orders , which exempt or exclude businesses that have been designated essential critical infrastructure , such as ours , from various restrictions they impose . as of december 31 , 2020 , we had liquidity , which included cash on hand and availability under our $ 350.0 million revolving credit facility of $ 229.7 million , and we have no debt maturities until 2023. our wood pellet production capacity is committed under long-term , take-or-pay off-take contracts with fixed pricing and fixed volumes that are not impacted by the market prices of crude oil , natural gas , power or heat . furthermore , most of our current deliveries are to europe , where they fuel grid-critical base load , dispatchable generation facilities that provide power and heat required for local communities to navigate through their own covid-19 responses . as of december 31 , 2020 , each of our customers is in compliance with their agreements with us , including payment terms . we do , however , remain vigilant about the unfolding global crisis and continue to monitor and manage the potential health , safety , business and other risks associated with the covid-19 pandemic .

"the full magnitude of the impact of the covid-19 pandemic on the company 's financial condition , liquidity , and future results of operations will depend on future developments , which are highly uncertain . the company has taken actions to mitigate the operating and financial impact of the covid-19 pandemic including suspending monthly dividends , reducing 2020 capital expenditures , borrowing under its credit facility , obtaining credit facility covenant waivers , and temporarily reducing executive compensation . overview chatham lodging trust ( “ we , ” “ us ” or the “ company ” ) was formed as a maryland real estate investment trust on october 26 , 2009. the company is internally-managed and was organized to invest primarily in upscale extended-stay and premium-branded select-service hotels in geographically diverse markets with high barriers to entry near strong demand generators . the company has elected to be taxed as a real estate investment trust for federal income tax purposes ( `` reit '' ) . the company had no operations prior to the consummation of its ipo . the net proceeds from our share offerings are contributed to chatham lodging , l.p. , our operating partnership ( the “ operating partnership ” ) , in exchange for partnership interests . substantially all of the company 's assets are held by , and all operations are conducted through , the operating partnership . the company is the sole general partner of the operating partnership and owns 100 % of the common units of limited partnership interest in the operating partnership ( `` common units '' ) . certain of the company 's employees hold vested and unvested long-term incentive plan units in the operating partnership ( `` ltip units '' ) , which are presented as non-controlling interests on our consolidated balance sheets . as of december 31 , 2020 , the company owned 39 hotels with an aggregate of 5,900 rooms located in 15 states and the district of columbia . the company also ( i ) held a 10.3 % noncontrolling interest in a joint venture ( the “ newink jv ” ) with affiliates of colony capital , inc. ( `` clny '' ) , which was formed in the second quarter of 2014 to acquire 46 hotels from a joint venture ( the `` innkeepers jv '' ) between the company and cerberus capital management ( “ cerberus ” ) , comprising an aggregate of 5,948 rooms and ( ii ) held a 10.0 % noncontrolling interest in a separate joint venture ( the `` inland jv '' ) with clny , which was formed in the fourth quarter of 2014 to acquire 48 hotels from inland american real estate trust , inc. ( `` inland '' ) , comprising an aggregate of 6,402 rooms . as of december 31 , 2020 , the inland jv hotels are in receivership . we sometimes use the term `` jvs '' which refers collectively to the newink jv and the inland jv . to qualify as a reit , the company can not operate its hotels . therefore , the operating partnership and its subsidiaries lease each of the company 's wholly owned hotels to a taxable reit subsidiary lessee ( “ trs lessee ” ) , which is wholly owned by the company 's taxable reit subsidiary ( “ trs ” ) holding company . the company indirectly ( i ) owns its 10.3 % interest in the 46 newink jv hotels and ( ii ) 10.0 % interest in the 48 inland jv hotels through the operating partnership . all of the newink jv hotels and inland jv hotels are leased to trs lessees , in which the company indirectly owns or owned as applicable , noncontrolling interests through its trs holding company . each hotel is leased to a trs lessee under a percentage lease that provides for rental payments equal to the greater of ( i ) a fixed base rent amount or ( ii ) a percentage rent based on hotel room revenue . the initial term of each of the trs leases is 5 years . lease revenue from each trs lessee is eliminated in consolidation . the trs lessees have entered into management agreements with third-party management companies that provide day-to-day management for the hotels . as of december 31 , 2020 , island hospitality management inc. ( “ ihm ” ) , which is 52.5 % owned by mr. fisher , managed all 39 of the company 's wholly owned hotels . as of december 31 , 2020 , all of the newink jv hotels were managed by ihm . as of december 31 , 2020 , none of the inland jv hotels were managed by ihm . 43 key indicators of operating performance and financial condition we measure financial condition and hotel operating performance by evaluating non-financial and financial metrics and measures such as : average daily rate ( “ adr ” ) , which is the quotient of room revenue divided by total rooms sold , occupancy , which is the quotient of total rooms sold divided by total rooms available , revenue per available room ( “ revpar ” ) , which is the product of occupancy and adr , and does not include food and beverage revenue , or other operating revenue , funds from operations ( “ ffo ” ) , adjusted ffo , earnings before interest , taxes , depreciation and amortization ( “ ebitda ” ) , ebitda re , adjusted ebitda , and adjusted hotel ebitda . we evaluate the hotels in our portfolio and potential acquisitions using these metrics to determine each hotel 's contribution toward providing income to our shareholders through increases in distributable cash flow and increasing long-term total returns through appreciation in the value of our common shares . revpar , adr and occupancy are hotel industry measures commonly used to evaluate operating performance . see “ non-gaap financial measures ” for further discussion of ffo , adjusted ffo , ebitda , ebitda re , adjusted ebitda and adjusted hotel ebitda . story_separator_special_tag interest expense , including amortization of deferred fees interest expense decreased $ 0.1 million , or 0.3 % , from $ 28.2 million for the year ended december 31 , 2019 to $ 28.1 million for the year ended december 31 , 2020. interest expense is comprised of the following ( dollars in thousands ) : replace_table_token_12_th loss from unconsolidated real estate entities loss from unconsolidated real estate entities increased $ 1.0 million from a loss of $ 6.4 million for the year ended december 31 , 2019 to a loss of $ 7.4 million for the year ended december 31 , 2020. the increase is due primarily to a decline in operating performance due to the covid-19 pandemic . income tax expense income tax expense remained unchanged at zero for the year ended december 31 , 2019 and 2020. we are subject to income taxes based on the taxable income of our trs lessees at a combined federal and state tax rate of approximately 25 % . the company 's trs is expecting taxable losses in 2021 and recognizes a full valuation allowance equal to 100 % of the net deferred tax assets , with the exception of the amt tax credit , due to the uncertainty of the trs 's ability to utilize these net deferred tax assets . net loss net loss was $ 77.0 million for the year ended december 31 , 2020 , compared to net income of $ 18.9 million for the year ended december 31 , 2019. the decrease in our net income was due to the factors discussed above . material trends or uncertainties we are not aware of any material trends or uncertainties , favorable or unfavorable , that may be reasonably anticipated to have a material impact on either the capital resources or the revenues or income to be derived from the acquisition and operation of properties , loans and other permitted investments , other than those referred to in this section and the risk factors identified in the “ risk factors ” section of this annual report on this form 10-k. 48 non-gaap financial measures we consider the following non-gaap financial measures useful to investors as key supplemental measures of our operating performance : ( 1 ) ffo , ( 2 ) adjusted ffo , ( 3 ) ebitda , ( 4 ) ebitda re , ( 5 ) adjusted ebitda and ( 6 ) adjusted hotel ebitda . these non-gaap financial measures should be considered along with , but not as alternatives to , net income or loss as prescribed by gaap as a measure of our operating performance . ffo , adjusted ffo , ebitda , ebitda re , adjusted ebitda and adjusted hotel ebitda do not represent cash generated from operating activities under gaap and should not be considered as alternatives to net income or loss , cash flows from operations or any other operating performance measure prescribed by gaap . ffo , adjusted ffo , ebitda , ebitda re , adjusted ebitda and adjusted hotel ebitda are not measures of our liquidity , nor are ffo , adjusted ffo , ebitda , ebitda re , adjusted ebitda or adjusted hotel ebitda indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs , including our ability to make cash distributions . these measurements do not reflect cash expenditures for long-term assets and other items that have been and will be incurred . ffo , adjusted ffo , ebitda , ebitda re , adjusted ebitda and adjusted hotel ebitda may include funds that may not be available for management 's discretionary use due to functional requirements to conserve funds for capital expenditures , property acquisitions , and other commitments and uncertainties . we calculate ffo in accordance with standards established by the national association of real estate investment trusts ( `` nareit '' ) , which defines ffo as net income or loss ( calculated in accordance with gaap ) , excluding gains or losses from sales of real estate , impairment write-downs , the cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles , plus depreciation and amortization ( excluding amortization of deferred financing costs ) , and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures following the same approach . we believe that the presentation of ffo provides useful information to investors regarding our operating performance because it measures our performance without regard to specified non-cash items such as real estate depreciation and amortization , gain or loss on sale of real estate assets and certain other items that we believe are not indicative of the property level performance of our hotel properties . we believe that these items reflect historical cost of our asset base and our acquisition and disposition activities and are less reflective of our ongoing operations , and that by adjusting to exclude the effects of the items , ffo is useful to investors in comparing our operating performance between periods and between reits that report ffo using the nareit definition . we calculate adjusted ffo by further adjusting ffo for certain additional items that are not addressed in nareit 's definition of ffo , including other charges , costs associated with the departure of our former chief investment officer , losses on the early extinguishment of debt and similar items related to our unconsolidated real estate entities that we believe do not represent costs related to hotel operations . we believe that adjusted ffo provides investors with another financial measure that may facilitate comparisons of operating performance between periods and between reits that make similar adjustments to ffo .
","results of operations industry outlook the lodging industry has been significantly impacted by the covid-19 pandemic and there has been a significant decline in travel . smith travel research reported that u.s. lodging industry revpar declined 47.5 % for the year ended december 31 , 2020 , with revpar down 19.3 % in the first quarter of 2020 , down 45.5 % in the second quarter of 2020 , down 48.5 % in the third quarter of 2020 and down 50.6 % in the fourth quarter of 2020. we expect the current trend of depressed revpar levels to continue until there is widespread deployment of effective covid-19 vaccines . the full impact of the covid-19 pandemic on the lodging industry continues to evolve and will depend on future developments including the duration and spread of the outbreak , the existence of governmental stay-at-home orders , deployment of vaccines , peoples ' willingness to travel , and the strength and timing of an economic recovery . all of these factors are uncertain , and the full impact of the covid-19 pandemic on the lodging industry can not be predicted at this time . comparison of the year ended december 31 , 2020 ( “ 2020 ” ) to the year ended december 31 , 2019 ( “ 2019 ” ) the section below provides a comparative discussion of our consolidated results of operations between fiscal 2020 and 2019. see item 7 , `` management 's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations '' in our annual report on form 10-k for the fiscal year ended december 31 , 2019 for comparative a discussion of our consolidated results of operations between fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2018. results of operations for the year ended december 31 , 2020 include the operating activities of our 39 wholly owned hotels that were owned for the entire period , partial period results for one hotel which was sold during the period and our investments in the newink

financial statements , which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america . the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities , revenues and expenses , and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements . story_separator_special_tag c ) a reduction in the accrued interest . d ) extensions , deferrals , renewals and rewrites . the bank measures the allowance for loan losses of restructured loans based on the difference between the original loan 's carrying amount and the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the original effective yield of the loan . based on published guidance with respect to restructured loans from certain banking regulators and to conform to general practices within the banking industry , the bank determined it was appropriate to maintain certain restructured loans on accrual status because there is reasonable assurance of repayment and performance , consistent with the modified terms based upon a current , well-documented credit evaluation . other restructured loans are classified as “ substandard ” and placed on non-performing status . the loans may be upgraded and placed on accrual status once there is a sustained period of payment performance ( usually six months or 12 months for loans that have been modified more than once ) and there is a reasonable assurance that the payments will continue ; and if the borrower has demonstrated satisfactory contractual payments beyond 12 consecutive months , the loan is no longer categorized as a restructured loan . in addition to the payment history described above ; multi-family , commercial real estate , construction and commercial business loans must also demonstrate a combination of corroborating characteristics to be upgraded , such as : satisfactory cash flow , satisfactory guarantor support , and additional collateral support , among others . to qualify for restructuring , a borrower must provide evidence of their creditworthiness such as , current financial statements , their most recent income tax returns , current paystubs , current w-2s , and most recent bank statements , among other documents , which are then verified by the bank . the bank re-underwrites the loan with the borrower 's updated financial information , new credit report , current loan balance , new interest rate , remaining loan term , updated property value and modified payment schedule , among other considerations , to determine if the borrower qualifies . interest is not accrued on any loan when its contractual payments are more than 90 days delinquent or if the loan is deemed impaired . in addition , interest is not recognized on any loan where management has determined that collection is not reasonably assured . a non-accrual loan may be restored to accrual status when delinquent principal and interest payments are brought current and future monthly principal and interest payments are expected to be collected . asc 815 , “ derivatives and hedging , ” requires that derivatives of the corporation be recorded in the consolidated financial statements at fair value . management considers its accounting policy for derivatives to be a critical 69 accounting policy because these instruments have certain interest rate risk characteristics that change in value based upon changes in the capital markets . the corporation 's derivatives are primarily the result of its mortgage banking activities in the form of commitments to extend credit , commitments to sell loans , commitments to sell mbs and option contracts to mitigate the risk of the commitments to extend credit . estimates of the percentage of commitments to extend credit on loans to be held for sale that may not fund are based upon historical data and current market trends . the fair value adjustments of the derivatives are recorded in the consolidated statements of operations with offsets to other assets or other liabilities in the consolidated statements of financial condition . management accounts for income taxes by estimating future tax effects of temporary differences between the tax and book basis of assets and liabilities considering the provisions of enacted tax laws . these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities , which are included in the corporation 's consolidated statements of financial condition . the application of income tax law is inherently complex . laws and regulations in this area are voluminous and are often ambiguous . as such , management is required to make many subjective assumptions and judgments regarding the corporation 's income tax exposures , including judgments in determining the amount and timing of recognition of the resulting deferred tax assets and liabilities , including projections of future taxable income . interpretations of and guidance surrounding income tax laws and regulations change over time . as such , changes in management 's subjective assumptions and judgments can materially affect amounts recognized in the consolidated statements of financial condition and consolidated statements of operations . therefore , management considers its accounting for income taxes a critical accounting policy . executive summary and operating strategy provident savings bank , f.s.b. , established in 1956 , is a financial services company committed to serving consumers and small to

and ( 2 ) incremental expenses of $ 7.5 million from our acquisition of the north american automotive ignition wire business of general cable corporation , including amortization of intangible assets acquired . restructuring and integration expenses ( income ) . restructuring and integration expenses were $ 4 million in 2016 compared to restructuring and integration income of $ 0.1 million in 2015. the $ 4.1 million year-over-year increase in restructuring and integration expenses reflects primarily the impact of the plant rationalization program that commenced in february 2016 and the wire and cable relocation program announced in october 2016. other income , net . other income , net was $ 1.2 million in 2016 compared to $ 1 million in 2015. during 2016 and 2015 , we recognized $ 1 million of deferred gain related to the sale-leaseback of our long island city , new york facility . operating income . operating income was $ 98.1 million in 2016 , compared to $ 75.9 million in 2015. the year-over-year increase in operating income of $ 22.2 million is the result of higher consolidated net sales and higher gross margins as a percentage of consolidated net sales offset , in part , by higher sg & a expenses and higher restructuring and integration expenses . other non-operating income , net . other non-operating income , net was $ 2.1 million in 2016 , compared to other non-operating expense , net of $ 0.2 million in 2015. the year-over-year increase in other non-operating income , net resulted primarily from the increase in equity income from our joint ventures , the favorable impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and the year-over-year impact of the write-off in 2015 of $ 0.8 million of unamortized deferred finance costs associated with the refinancing of the prior revolving credit facility . 30 index interest expense .
","comparison of fiscal years 2015 and 2014 sales . consolidated net sales for 2015 were $ 972 million , a decrease of $ 8.4 million compared to $ 980.4 million in the same period of 2014. consolidated net sales at our engine management segment decreased year-over-year , which more than offset the increase in sales at our temperature control segment . had the same canadian dollar and polish zloty exchange rates applied in 2014 been used in 2015 , net sales for 2015 would have been $ 8.2 million higher , or $ 980.2 million . the following table summarizes consolidated net sales by segment and by major product group within each segment for the years ended december 31 , 2015 and 2014 ( in thousands ) : replace_table_token_10_th engine management 's net sales decreased $ 11.2 million , or 1.6 % , to $ 698 million for 2015. net sales in the ignition , emissions and fuel systems parts product group for the year ended december 31 , 2015 were $ 598.2 million , a decrease of $ 2.7 million , or 0.5 % , compared to $ 600.9 million in the same period of 2014. net sales in the wire and cable product group for the year ended december 31 , 2015 were $ 99.9 million , a decrease of $ 8.5 million , or 7.8 % , compared to $ 108.4 million in the year ended december 31 , 2014. net sales in 2015 were negatively impacted by customer ordering patterns and diesel injector returns for quality inspection . also contributing to the reduction in net sales was the negative impact of foreign currency exchange rates . had the same polish zloty exchange rate applied in 2014 been used in 2015 , net sales for 2015 would have been $ 1.5 million higher , or $ 699.5 million . 31 index temperature control 's net sales increased $ 5.4 million , or 2.1 % , to $ 264.5 million for 2015.

and factors that may affect results you should read the following discussion and analysis in conjunction with our financial statements and related notes contained elsewhere in this report . this discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks , uncertainties , and assumptions . our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of a variety of factors , including those set forth under item 1a . risk factors . overview we are a leading worldwide developer and supplier of custom-designed human interface solutions that enable people to interact more easily and intuitively with a wide variety of mobile computing , communications , entertainment , and other electronic devices . we believe our results to date reflect the combination of our customer focus , the strength of our intellectual property , and our engineering know-how , which allow us to develop or engineer products that meet the demanding design specifications of oems . we recognize revenue from product sales when there is persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists , delivery has occurred or title has transferred , the price is fixed or determinable , and collection is reasonably assured . our net revenue increased from $ 266.8 million for fiscal 2007 to $ 598.5 million for fiscal 2011 , representing a compound annual growth rate of approximately 22 % . for fiscal 2007 , we derived 85 % of our net revenue from the personal computer market and 15 % of our net revenue from the digital lifestyle product markets . for fiscal 2011 , revenue from the personal computer market accounted for 48 % of our net revenue and revenue from the digital lifestyle product markets accounted for 52 % of our net revenue . many of our customers have migrated their manufacturing operations from taiwan to china , and many of our oem customers have established design centers in that region . with our expanded global presence , including offices in china , finland , hong kong , japan , korea , switzerland , taiwan , and the united states , we are well positioned to provide local sales , operational , and engineering support services to our existing customers , as well as potential new customers , on a global basis . our manufacturing operations are based on a variable cost model in which we outsource all of our production requirements and generally drop ship our products directly to our customers from our contract manufacturers ' facilities , eliminating the need for significant capital expenditures and allowing us to minimize our investment in inventories . this approach requires us to work closely with our contract manufacturers to ensure adequate production capacity to meet our forecasted volume requirements . we provide our contract manufacturers with six-month rolling forecasts and issue purchase orders based on our anticipated requirements for the next 90 days . however , we do not have any long-term supply contracts with any of our contract manufacturers . we use three third-party wafer manufacturers to supply wafers and two third-party packaging manufacturers to package our proprietary asics . in certain cases , we rely on a single source or a limited number of suppliers to provide other key components of our products . our cost of revenue includes all costs associated with the production of our products , including materials , logistics , manufacturing , assembly , and test costs paid to third-party manufacturers and related overhead costs associated with our indirect manufacturing operations personnel . additionally , we charge all warranty costs , yield losses , and any inventory provisions or write-downs to cost of revenue . our gross margin generally reflects the combination of the added value we bring to our oem customers ' products in meeting their custom design requirements and the impact of our ongoing cost-improvement programs . these cost-improvement programs include reducing materials and component costs and implementing design and process improvements . our newly introduced products may have lower margins than our more mature products , which have realized greater benefits associated with our ongoing cost-improvement programs . as a result , new product introductions may initially negatively impact our gross margin . our research and development expenses include costs for supplies and materials related to product development , as well as the engineering costs incurred to design human interface solutions for oem customers prior to and after their commitment to incorporate those solutions into their products . these expenses have generally increased , reflecting our continuing commitment to the technological and design innovation required to maintain our position in our existing markets and to adapt our existing technologies or develop new technologies for new markets . 38 selling , general , and administrative expenses include expenses related to sales , marketing , and administrative personnel ; internal sales and outside sales representatives ' commissions ; market and usability research ; outside legal , accounting , and consulting costs ; and other marketing and sales activities . story_separator_special_tag the effect of these write-downs is to establish a new cost basis in the related inventory , which we do not subsequently write up . share-based compensation costs we account for employee share-based compensation costs in accordance with relevant accounting standards . we utilize the black-scholes option pricing model to estimate the grant date fair value of employee share-based compensatory awards , which requires the input of highly subjective assumptions , including expected volatility and expected life . historical and implied volatilities were used in estimating the fair value of our share-based awards . the expected life for our options was previously estimated based on historical trends since our initial public offering . in fiscal 2011 , we began to grant options with a contractual life of seven years rather than ten years and now use the simplified method of establishing the expected life as we do not have any history of options with seven-year lives . estimated forfeitures for share-based awards that are not expected to vest are estimated based on historical trends since our initial public offering . changes in these inputs and assumptions can materially affect the measure of estimated fair value of our share-based compensation . we charge the estimated fair value less estimated forfeitures to earnings on a straight-line basis over the vesting period of the underlying awards , which is generally four years for our stock options and dsus and up to two years for our employee stock purchase plan . the black-scholes option pricing model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options that have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable . as our stock option and our employee stock purchase plan awards have characteristics that differ significantly from traded options , and as changes in the subjective assumptions can materially affect the estimated value , our estimate of fair value may not accurately represent the value assigned by a third party in an arms-length transaction . there currently is no market-based mechanism to verify the reliability and accuracy of the estimates derived from the black-scholes option pricing model or other allowable valuation models , nor is there a means to compare and adjust the estimates to actual values . while our estimate of fair value and the associated charge to earnings materially affects our results of operations , it has no impact on our cash position . there are significant variations among allowable valuation models , and there is a possibility that we may adopt a different valuation model or refine the inputs and assumptions under our current valuation model in the future , resulting in a lack of consistency in future periods . our current or future valuation model and the inputs and assumptions we make may also lack comparability to other companies that use different models , inputs , or assumptions , and the resulting differences in comparability could be material . income taxes we recognize federal , foreign , and state current tax liabilities or assets based on our estimate of taxes payable or refundable in the then current fiscal year for each tax jurisdiction . we also recognize federal , foreign , and state deferred tax liabilities or assets for our estimate of future tax effects attributable to temporary differences and carryforwards and record a valuation allowance to reduce any deferred tax assets by the amount of any tax benefits that , based on available evidence and our judgment , are not expected to be realized . if our assumptions , and consequently our estimates , change in the future , the valuation allowance we have established for our deferred tax assets may be changed , which could impact income tax expense . 40 we use a two-step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions . the first step is to determine whether it is more-likely-than-not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination , including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes . the second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50 % likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority . the calculation of tax liabilities involves significant judgment in estimating the impact of uncertainties in the application of highly complex tax laws . resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with our expectations could have a material impact on our consolidated financial position , result of operations , or cash flows . we believe we have adequately provided for reasonably foreseeable outcomes in connection with the resolution of income tax uncertainties . however , our results have in the past , and could in the future , include favorable and unfavorable adjustments to our estimated tax liabilities in the period a determination of such estimated tax liability is made or resolved , upon the filing of an amended return , upon a change in facts , circumstances , or interpretation , or upon the expiration of a statute of limitation . accordingly , our effective tax rate could fluctuate materially from period to period . we consider the operating earnings of our foreign subsidiaries to be indefinitely invested outside the united states . accordingly , no provision has been made for the u.s. federal , state , or foreign taxes that may result from future remittances of undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries . we recognize tax benefit upon expensing certain share-based awards associated with our share-based compensation plans , including nonqualified stock options and dsus , but we can not recognize tax benefit concurrent with the recognition of share-based compensation expenses associated with qualified stock options ( incentive stock options and employee stock purchase plan shares ) . for qualified stock options that vested after we began to expense share-based compensation , we recognize tax benefit only in the period when disqualifying dispositions of the underlying stock occur , which historically has been up to several years after vesting and in a period when our stock price substantially increases .

"forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks , uncertainties and other factors that may cause the actual results to differ materially from any future results , performance or achievements expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements . such factors may include , among others , those factors listed in item 1a of and elsewhere in this annual report and our other filings with the securities and exchange commission . the following discussion should be read in conjunction with selected financial data above ( item 6 of this annual report ) and our financial statements and related footnotes appearing elsewhere in this annual report . overview famous dave 's of america , inc. was incorporated as a minnesota corporation in march 1994 and opened its first restaurant in minneapolis in june 1995. as of december 29 , 2013 , there were 194 famous dave 's restaurants operating in 34 states , the commonwealth of puerto rico , and 1 canadian province , including 54 company-owned restaurants and 140 franchise-operated restaurants . an additional 60 franchise restaurants were committed to be developed through signed area development agreements as of december 29 , 2013. fiscal year our fiscal year ends on the sunday nearest december 31st of each year . our fiscal year is generally 52 weeks ; however it periodically consists of 53 weeks . the fiscal years ended december 29 , 2013 ( fiscal 2013 ) , december 30 , 2012 ( fiscal 2012 ) , and january 1 , 2012 ( fiscal 2011 ) all consisted of 52 weeks . fiscal 2014 , which ends on december 28 , 2014 , will consist of 52 weeks . basis of presentation  the financial results presented and discussed herein reflect our results and the results of our wholly-owned and majority-owned consolidated subsidiaries . all intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation . certain reclassifications have been made to prior year amounts to conform to the current year 's presentation . during fiscal 2013 , in order to be more comparable to other public restaurant companies , the company made the decision to reflect multi-unit supervision expenses within general and administrative expenses as opposed to operating expenses , where it previously had been reflected . all prior years ' results shown have been reclassified to be comparable with the current fiscal year 's presentation . for each of fiscal 2012 and fiscal 2011 , this adjustment was approximately $ 1.9 million . application of critical accounting policies and estimates  the following discussion and analysis of the company 's financial condition and results of operations is based upon its financial statements , which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states . the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets , liabilities and expenses , and related disclosures . on an on-going basis , management evaluates its estimates and judgments . by their nature , these estimates and judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty . management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience , observance of trends in the industry , information provided by customers and other outside sources and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances , the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources . actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions . management believes the following critical accounting policies reflect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the company 's consolidated financial statements . our company 's significant accounting policies are described in ( note 1 ) to the consolidated financial statements included herein . 26 we have discussed the development and selection of the following critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors and the audit committee has reviewed our disclosures relating to such estimates in this management 's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations . recognition of franchise-related revenue  initial franchise fee revenue is recognized when we have performed substantially all of our obligations as franchisor . franchise royalties are recognized when earned . our franchise-related revenue is comprised of three separate and distinct earnings processes : area development fees , initial franchise fees and continuing royalty payments . currently , our domestic area development fee for domestic growth consists of a one-time , non-refundable payment of approximately $ 10,000 per restaurant in consideration for the services we perform in preparation of executing each area development agreement . for our foreign area development agreements the one time , non-refundable payment is negotiated on a per development basis and is determined based on the costs incurred to sell that development agreement . substantially all of these services , which include , but are not limited to , a review of the potential franchisee 's current operations , conducting market and trade area analysis , a meeting with famous dave 's executive team , and performing a potential franchise background investigation , are completed prior to our execution of the area development agreement and receipt of the corresponding area development fee . as a result , we recognize this fee in full upon receipt . currently , our initial , non-refundable , franchise fee for domestic growth is $ 45,000 per restaurant , of which approximately $ 5,000 is recognized immediately when a franchise agreement is signed , reflecting expenses incurred related to the sale . the remaining non-refundable fee is included in deferred franchise fees and is recognized as revenue when we have performed substantially all of our obligations , which generally occurs upon the franchise entering into a lease agreement for the restaurant ( s ) . finally , franchisees are also required to pay us a monthly royalty equal to a percentage of their net sales , which has historically varied from 4 % to 5 % . story_separator_special_tag our estimates are based on the information available to us at the time that we prepare the income tax provision . we generally file our annual income tax returns several months after our fiscal year-end . income tax returns are subject to audit by federal , state , and local governments , generally years after the tax returns are filed . these returns could be subject to material adjustments or differing interpretations of the tax laws . accounting for uncertain tax positions requires significant judgment including estimating the amount , timing , and likelihood of ultimate settlement . although the company believes that its estimates are reasonable , actual results could differ from these estimates . additionally , uncertain positions may be re-measured as warranted by changes in facts or law . during 2012 , we realized the benefit from the cumulative impact of tax credits for employee reported tips for 2012 as well as four previous tax years that were amended , or in the case of fiscal 2011 , initially filed . this resulted from a more precise calculation methodology for this tax credit , and will continue to benefit us in the future . story_separator_special_tag and under mr. rensi 's leadership , we are in the process of evaluating and assessing various aspects of our business that may impact our budgets and expected financial performance for fiscal 2014. as a result , we believe that it is premature to provide any guidance for fiscal 2014 in this report and have elected not to do so . we will re-assess the advisability of providing guidance in the future commencing with our quarterly report on form 10-q for the first fiscal quarter of 2014. total revenue total revenue of approximately $ 155.4 million for fiscal 2013 increased approximately $ 444,000 , or 0.3 % , from total revenue of $ 155.0 in fiscal 2012. fiscal 2013 and 2012 both consisted of 52 weeks . restaurant sales , net restaurant sales for fiscal 2013 were approximately $ 136.9 million , compared to approximately $ 135.7 million for fiscal 2012 reflecting a 0.9 % increase . total restaurant sales reflected a 0.2 % comparable sales increase , by the annualized impact of two company-owned restaurants that opened in fiscal 2012 , and the partial year impact of two company-owned restaurants that opened in fiscal 2013 , as well as a weighted average price increase of approximately 2.5 % . this increase was partially offset by the closure of one company owned restaurant . the overall 0.2 % comparable sales increase was , on a weighted basis , comprised of a 1.9 % comparable sales decrease for dine-in sales , a 30 0.6 % comparable sales decrease for catering , partially offset by a comparable sales increase for to go of 2.6 % . for fiscal 2013 , off-premise sales were 35.6 % of total sales , with catering at 9.8 % and to go at 25.8 % . this compares to 2012 's off-premise sales of 33.4 % with catering at 10.5 % and to go at 22.9 % . as a percentage of dine-in sales , our adult beverage sales at our company-owned restaurants were approximately 9.5 % for both fiscal 2013 and 2012. franchise-related revenue franchise-related revenue consists of royalty revenue and franchise fees , which includes initial franchise fees and area development fees . franchise-related revenue was approximately $ 17.4 million for fiscal 2013 , compared to $ 18.1 million for 2012. the decrease in franchise-related revenue is primarily related to decreases in franchise fees and royalty revenue resulting from a franchise comparable sales decrease of 2.9 % , partially offset by revenue generated from a net five new franchise restaurants year over year . although our committed units to be developed decreased by two units year over year ; the commitments were reflected by the execution of several smaller agreements . fiscal 2013 included 6,971 franchise operating weeks , compared to 6,848 franchise operating weeks in fiscal 2012. there were 140 franchise-operated restaurants open at december 29 , 2013 , compared to 135 at december 30 , 2012. licensing and other revenue licensing revenue includes royalties from a retail line of business , including sauces , rubs , marinades and seasonings . other revenue includes opening assistance and training we provide to our franchise partners . licensing royalty revenue was approximately $ 805,000 for fiscal 2013 as compared to $ 731,000 for fiscal 2012. other revenue for fiscal 2013 was approximately $ 311,000 compared to approximately $ 443,000 for the comparable period of fiscal 2012. the decrease was primarily due to a decrease in the number of franchise openings year over year and a corresponding decrease in the opening assistance required . same store net sales it is our policy to include in our same store net sales base , restaurants that are open year round and have been open at least 24 months . same store net sales for company-owned restaurants open at least 24 months ended december 29 , 2013 increased 0.2 % , compared to fiscal 2012 's decrease of 1.8 % . for fiscal 2013 and fiscal 2012 , there were 48 and 49 restaurants ,

","results of operations revenue  our revenue consists of four components : company-owned restaurant sales , franchise-related revenue from royalties and franchise fees , licensing revenue from the retail sale of our sauces and rubs , and other revenue from the opening assistance we provide to franchise partners . we record restaurant sales at the time food and beverages are served . our revenue recognition policies for franchising are discussed under recognition of franchise-related revenue above . our franchise-related revenue consists of area development fees , initial franchise fees and continuing royalty payments . we record sales of merchandise items at the time items are delivered to the customer . we have a licensing agreement for our retail products , with renewal options of five years , subject to the licensee 's attainment of identified minimum product sales levels . based on achievement of the required minimum product sales , the agreement will be in force until april 2015 at which time these levels will be re-evaluated . 28 periodically , we provide additional services , beyond the general franchise agreement , to our franchise operations , such as new restaurant training and décor installation services . the cost of these services is billed to the respective franchisee , is recorded as other income when the service is provided , and is generally payable on net 30-day terms . since 2010 , the franchise agreements require a 50 % deposit be paid in advance for these services . costs and expenses  restaurant costs and expenses include food and beverage costs , labor and benefits costs , operating expenses which include occupancy costs , repair and maintenance costs , supplies , advertising and promotion , and restaurant depreciation and amortization . certain of these costs and expenses are variable and will increase or decrease with sales volume . the primary fixed costs are corporate and restaurant management salaries and occupancy costs .

"you should read this information in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included in this annual report . see also “ cautionary statement concerning forward-looking statements ” immediately prior to part i , item 1 in this annual report . we categorize revenue from our cruise and cruise-related activities as either “ passenger ticket ” revenue or “ onboard and other ” revenue . passenger ticket revenue and onboard and other revenue vary according to product offering , the size of the ship in operation , the length of cruises operated and the markets in which the ship operates . our revenue is seasonal based on demand for cruises , which has historically been strongest during the northern hemisphere 's summer months . passenger ticket revenue primarily consists of revenue for accommodations , meals in certain restaurants on the ship , certain onboard entertainment , and includes revenue for service charges and air and land transportation to and from the ship to the extent guests purchase these items from us . onboard and other revenue primarily consists of revenue from gaming , beverage sales , shore excursions , specialty dining , retail sales , spa services and photo services . our onboard revenue is derived from onboard activities we perform directly or that are performed by independent concessionaires , from which we receive a share of their revenue . our cruise operating expense is classified as follows : · commissions , transportation and other primarily consists of direct costs associated with passenger ticket revenue . these costs include travel agent commissions , air and land transportation expenses , related credit card fees , certain port expenses and the costs associated with shore excursions and hotel accommodations included as part of the overall cruise purchase price . · onboard and other primarily consists of direct costs incurred in connection with onboard and other revenue , including casino , beverage sales and shore excursions . · payroll and related consists of the cost of wages and benefits for shipboard employees and costs of certain inventory items , including food , for a third party that provides crew and other hotel services for certain ships . · fuel includes fuel costs , the impact of certain fuel hedges and fuel delivery costs . · food consists of food costs for passengers and crew on certain ships . · other consists of repairs and maintenance ( including dry-dock costs ) , ship insurance and other ship expenses . critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with u.s. gaap . the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates , judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the periods presented . we rely on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances to make these estimates and judgments . actual results could differ materially from these estimates . we believe that the following critical accounting policies reflect the significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements . these critical accounting policies , which are presented in detail in our notes to our audited consolidated financial statements , relate to ship accounting , asset impairment and contingencies . ship accounting ships represent our most significant assets , and we record them at cost less accumulated depreciation . depreciation of ships is computed on a straight-line basis over the estimated service lives of primarily 30 years after a 15 % reduction for the estimated residual value of the ship . improvement costs that we believe add value to our ships are capitalized to the ship and depreciated over the shorter of the improvements ' estimated useful lives or the remaining useful life of the ship . repairs and maintenance activities are charged to expense as incurred . we account for dry-dock costs under the direct expense method which requires us to expense all dry-dock costs as incurred . 37 we determine the useful life of our ships based primarily on our estimates of the average useful life of the ships ' major component systems , such as cabins , main diesels , main electric , superstructure and hull . in addition , we consider the impact of anticipated changes in the vacation market and technological conditions and historical useful lives of similarly-built ships . given the large and complex nature of our ships , our accounting estimates related to ships and determinations of ship improvement costs to be capitalized require considerable judgment and are inherently uncertain . should certain factors or circumstances cause us to revise our estimate of ship service lives or projected residual values , depreciation expense could be materially lower or higher . if circumstances cause us to change our assumptions in making determinations as to whether ship improvements should be capitalized , the amounts we expense each year as repairs and maintenance costs could increase , partially offset by a decrease in depreciation expense . if we reduced our estimated average 30-year ship service life by one year , depreciation expense for the year ended december 31 , 2018 would have increased by $ 13.3 million . in addition , if our ships were estimated to have no residual value , depreciation expense for the same period would have increased by $ 65.9 million . we believe our estimates for ship accounting are reasonable and our methods are consistently applied . we believe that depreciation expense is based on a rational and systematic method to allocate our ships ' costs to the periods that benefit from the ships ' usage . asset impairment we review our long-lived assets , principally ships , for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable . story_separator_special_tag as our business includes the sourcing of passengers and deployment of vessels outside of the u.s. , a portion of our revenue and expenses are denominated in foreign currencies , particularly british pound , canadian dollar , euro and australian dollar which are subject to fluctuations in currency exchange rates versus our reporting currency , the u.s. dollar . in order to monitor results excluding these fluctuations , we calculate certain non-gaap measures on a constant currency basis , whereby current period revenue and expenses denominated in foreign currencies are converted to u.s. dollars using currency exchange rates of the comparable period . we believe that presenting these non-gaap measures on both a reported and constant currency basis is useful in providing a more comprehensive view of trends in our business . we believe that adjusted ebitda is appropriate as a supplemental financial measure as it is used by management to assess operating performance . we also believe that adjusted ebitda is a useful measure in determining our performance as it reflects certain operating drivers of our business , such as sales growth , operating costs , marketing , general and administrative expense and other operating income and expense . adjusted ebitda is not a defined term under gaap nor is it intended to be a measure of liquidity or cash flows from operations or a measure comparable to net income , as it does not take into account certain requirements such as capital expenditures and related depreciation , principal and interest payments and tax payments and it includes other supplemental adjustments . in addition , adjusted net revenue and adjusted net yield , which exclude certain business combination accounting entries , are non-gaap financial measures that we believe are useful as supplemental measures in evaluating the performance of our operating business and provide greater transparency into our results of operations . adjusted net income and adjusted eps are non-gaap financial measures that exclude certain amounts and are used to supplement gaap net income and eps . we use adjusted net income and adjusted eps as key performance measures of our earnings performance . we believe that both management and investors benefit from referring to these non-gaap financial measures in assessing our performance and when planning , forecasting and analyzing future periods . these non-gaap financial measures also facilitate management 's internal comparison to our historical performance . in addition , management uses adjusted eps as a performance measure for our incentive compensation . the amounts excluded in the presentation of these non-gaap financial measures may vary from period to period ; accordingly , our presentation of adjusted net revenue , adjusted net yield , adjusted net income and adjusted eps may not be indicative of future adjustments or results . for example , for the year ended december 31 , 2017 , we incurred an impairment of $ 2.9 million related to assets held for sale . a similar impairment was not incurred in the years ended december 31 , 2018 or december 31 , 2016. we included this as an adjustment in the reconciliation of adjusted net income since this impairment amount was not representative of our day-to-day operations and we have included similar non-representative adjustments in prior periods . 39 you are encouraged to evaluate each adjustment used in calculating our non-gaap financial measures and the reasons we consider our non-gaap financial measures appropriate for supplemental analysis . in evaluating our non-gaap financial measures , you should be aware that in the future we may incur expenses similar to the adjustments in our presentation . our non-gaap financial measures have limitations as analytical tools , and you should not consider these measures in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under gaap . our presentation of our non-gaap financial measures should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items . our non-gaap financial measures may not be comparable to other companies . please see a historical reconciliation of these measures to the most comparable gaap measure presented in our consolidated financial statements below in the “ results of operations ” section . story_separator_special_tag expenses , net related to the acquisition of prestige are

business of acquiring , investing in , financing and managing primarily mortgage-related assets and , to a lesser extent , financial assets . our objective is to manage a portfolio of investments that will deliver stable distributions to our stockholders over diverse economic conditions . we intend to achieve this objective through a combination of net interest margin and net realized capital gains from our investment portfolio . our portfolio includes certain credit sensitive assets and investments sourced from distressed markets in recent years that create the potential for capital gains , as well as more traditional types of mortgage-related investments that generate interest income . we have endeavored to build in recent years a diversified investment portfolio that includes elements of interest rate and credit risk , as we believe a portfolio diversified among interest rate and credit risks are best suited to delivering stable cash flows over various economic cycles . under our investment strategy , our targeted assets currently include multi-family cmbs , mezzanine loans to and preferred equity investments in owners of multi-family properties , residential mortgage loans , including loans sourced from distressed markets , and agency rmbs . subject to maintaining our qualification as a reit , we also may opportunistically acquire and manage various other types of mortgage-related and financial assets that we believe will compensate us appropriately for the risks associated with them , including , without limitation , non-agency rmbs ( which may include ios and pos ) , collateralized mortgage obligations and securities issued by newly originated residential securitizations , including credit sensitive securities from these securitizations . we strive to maintain and achieve a balanced and diverse funding mix to finance our assets and operations . to this end , we rely primarily on a combination of short-term borrowings , such as repurchase agreements with terms typically of 30 days , and longer term structured financings , such as securitization and re-securitization transactions , with terms longer than one year . we internally manage a certain portion of our portfolio , including agency arms , fixed-rate agency rmbs , non-agency rmbs , clos and residential securitized loans . in addition , as part of our investment strategy , we also contract with certain external investment managers to manage specific asset types targeted by us . we are a party to separate investment management agreements with headlands , midway , and riverbanc ,

net cash proceeds of approximately $ 55.1 million after deducting expenses associated with the transaction . story_separator_special_tag chairman bernanke reiterated a similar view in mid-july 2013 while reporting to the u.s. house of representatives ' financial services committee , but then softened the statement by noting that any such moderation in purchases could be adjusted depending on incoming economic data . however , despite the chairman 's uncertain outlook for tapering and the sluggish expansion of gdp in the first half of 2013 , the markets had priced in the expectation that the fomc would begin to taper in the near term , and that such tapering might be announced as early as september . in mid-september 2013 , contrary to the general market consensus , the fomc announced that it would maintain its current level of asset purchases under qe3 , thereby causing further uncertainty for interest rates and the credit markets . finally , on december 18 , 2013 , given indications that the u.s. economy had improved sufficiently , the federal reserve announced that it would reduce the pace of its purchases of ( i ) longer-term u.s. treasury securities to $ 40 billion per month and ( ii ) agency rmbs to $ 35 billion per month , and that it would likely reduce the pace of asset purchases in further measured steps to be announced at future meetings . in late january 2014 , the federal reserve announced that it would reduce its asset purchases by an additional $ 10 billion per month beginning in february 2014 . 43 the market reaction during the second and third quarters of 2013 to the possible tapering of qe3 was extremely negative , although volatility eased some and pricing improved for many fixed-income assets subsequent to the fomc 's mid-september 2013 announcement . the rate on the ten-year u.s. treasury note moved sharply higher after dropping to 1.63 % in early may , rising to 2.49 % at the end of the second quarter and to as high as 2.99 % in early september before falling to 2.61 % at the end of september , and then rising again to close at 3.03 % at the end of december 2013. as the yield on the ten-year u.s. treasury note advanced during 2013 , agency rmbs underperformed , in some cases dramatically , as evidenced by significantly lower pricing on these assets . however , losses on these assets recovered some subsequent to the fomc 's september announcement . with tapering now well underway , we believe that market conditions for many types of fixed income securities will be less volatile in 2014. notwithstanding the changes to qe3 , the fomc has maintained its intent to keep the target range for the federal funds rate between 0 % and 0.25 % until either the unemployment rate drops below 6.5 % or the projected inflation rate over the next one to two years increases above 2.5 % and longer-term inflation expectations continue to be well anchored , although the fomc has recently indicated that it may be necessary to maintain the current target range until well past the time that the unemployment rate declines below 6.5 % . unlike many mortgage reits , the market movements outlined above generally had a positive impact on our overall portfolio and results in 2013. although these movements had a meaningful negative impact on our existing agency rmbs portfolio ( including our agency ios ) , primarily during the second quarter of 2013 , which suffered from negative price movements outside of our hedged expectations , valuations for our multi-family cmbs and distressed residential loans responded to the market movements of 2013 in a generally positive manner , thereby mitigating to a large extent the downside impact of these events on our overall portfolio and helping us to achieve earnings growth in 2013. single-family homes and residential mortgage market . the residential real estate market showed signs of continued improvement in 2013 , although the rate of price gains have begun to slow some since april 2013. data released by s & p indices for its s & p/case-shiller home price indices for november 2013 showed that , on average , home prices have increased by 23.7 % for the 20-city composite as compared to march 2012. in addition , according to data provided by the u.s. department of commerce , there were 617,800 privately-owned housing starts for single family homes in 2013 , the highest since 2008 and up 15.4 % over last year . we expect the single-family residential real estate market to continue to improve in the near term , but believe that higher interest rates and tepid job creation will contribute to slowing housing gains for single family homes over the next 12 months . multi-family housing . apartments and other residential rental properties remain one of the better performing segments of the commercial real estate market . according to data provided by the u.s. department of commerce , there were 305,600 starts on multi-family homes , such as apartment buildings , the highest since 2007 and up 24.6 % over last year . we believe the performance of multi-family housing in the past year is due , in part , to a significant decline in new construction during the recent economic downturn and increased demand from former homeowners , which has driven stronger rental income growth across the country . in turn , these factors have led to recent valuation improvements for multi-family properties and negligible delinquencies on new multi-family loans originated by freddie mac and fannie mae . 44 developments at fannie mae and freddie mac . payments on the agency arms and fixed-rate agency rmbs in which we invest are guaranteed by fannie mae and freddie mac . in addition , although not guaranteed by freddie mac , all of our multi-family cmbs has been issued by securitization vehicles sponsored by freddie mac .

distributors , and our own direct-to-consumer channels . in addition , we license our columbia trademarks across a range of apparel , footwear , accessories and equipment . the popularity of outdoor activities , changing design trends , consumer adoption of innovative performance technologies and the availability and desirability of competitor alternatives affect consumer desire for our products . therefore , we seek to drive , anticipate and respond to trends and shifts in consumer preferences by adjusting the mix of available product offerings , developing new products with innovative performance features and designs , and creating persuasive and memorable marketing communications to generate consumer awareness , demand and retention . failure to anticipate or respond to consumer needs and preferences in a timely and adequate manner could have a material adverse effect on our sales and profitability . seasonality and variability of business our business is affected by the general seasonal trends common to the outdoor industry and is heavily dependent upon weather and discretionary consumer spending patterns . our products are marketed on a seasonal basis and our sales are weighted substantially toward the fall season , while our operating costs are more equally distributed throughout the year . the expansion of our direct-to-consumer operations has increased the proportion of sales and profits that we generate in the fourth calendar quarter . as a result , our sales and profits tend to be highest in the third and fourth calendar quarters . in 2012 , approximately 63 percent of our net sales and all of our profitability were realized in the second half of the year , illustrating our dependence upon sales results in the second half of the year , as well as the less seasonal nature of our operating costs . we generally solicit orders from wholesale customers and independent distributors for the fall and spring seasons based on seasonal ordering deadlines that we establish to aid our efforts in planning manufacturing volumes to meet demand for each of our selling seasons . we typically ship the majority of our advance fall season orders to wholesale customers and independent distributors beginning in june and continuing through november . similarly , the majority of our advance spring season orders ship to wholesale customers and independent distributors beginning in december and continuing through may . generally , orders are subject to cancellation prior to the date of shipment . results of operations in any period should not be considered indicative of the results to be expected for any future period , particularly in light of persistent volatility in economic conditions . sales of our products are subject to substantial cyclical fluctuation , the effects of unseasonable weather conditions , the relative popularity of competitors ' brands , and the continued popularity of outdoor activities as part of an active lifestyle in key markets . volatile economic environments in key markets , coupled with inflationary or volatile input costs , reduce the predictability of our business . 26 business outlook the global business climate continues to present us with a great deal of uncertainty , making it more difficult to predict future results . factors that could significantly affect our full year 2013 outlook include : unseasonable weather conditions or other unforeseen factors affecting consumer demand and the resulting effect on order cancellations , sales returns , customer accommodations , reorders , direct-to-consumer sales and suppressed demand in subsequent seasons ; changes in mix and volume of full price sales in contrast with closeout product sales and promotional sales activity ; increased costs to support supply chain and information technology infrastructure investments and projects , including our multi-year global enterprise resource planning ( `` erp '' ) system implementation ; our ability to implement and maintain effective cost containment measures in order to limit the growth of selling , general and administrative ( “ sg & a ” ) expenses to a rate comparable to or lower than sales growth ; continued economic uncertainty , which is creating headwinds in key global markets , particularly europe as it relates to our emea direct business where we have ongoing efforts to elevate the columbia brand ; the rate of new store expansion in our direct-to-consumer operations ; changes in consumer spending activity , including consumer acceptance of increased prices of our products ; and fluctuating currency exchange rates . like other branded consumer product companies , our business is heavily dependent upon discretionary consumer spending patterns . continuing high levels of unemployment and concerns about potential consumer price increases in our key markets continue to pose significant challenges and risks . story_separator_special_tag gross margin contraction was primarily due to : lower gross margins on increased promotional selling activities ; and higher product input costs ; partially offset by : increased wholesale pricing ; lower airfreight costs ; and 30 favorable foreign currency hedge rates . our gross profit may not be comparable to those of other companies in our industry because some

expense totaled $ 39.9 million in 2012 , compared to $ 42.9 million in 2011 . net licensing income : net licensing income decrease d $ 2.0 million , or 13 % , to $ 13.8 million in 2012 from $ 15.8 million in 2011 . the decrease in net licensing income was primarily due to decreased licensing income from accessories in the united states and decreased licensing income in the laap region ,

"our revenue is seasonal based on demand for cruises , which has historically been strongest during the summer months . passenger ticket revenue primarily consists of revenue for accommodations , meals in certain restaurants on the ship , certain onboard entertainment , and includes revenue for service charges and air and land transportation to and from the ship to the extent guests purchase these items from us . onboard and other revenue primarily consists of revenue from gaming , beverage sales , shore excursions , specialty dining , retail sales , spa services , photo services as well as charter revenue . we record onboard revenue from onboard activities we perform directly or that are performed by independent concessionaires , from which we receive a share of their revenue . our cruise operating expense is classified as follows : commissions , transportation and other primarily consists of direct costs associated with passenger ticket revenue . these costs include travel agent commissions , air and land transportation expenses , related credit card fees , costs associated with service charges , certain port expenses and the costs associated with shore excursions and hotel accomodations included as part of the overall cruise purchase price . onboard and other primarily consists of direct costs that are incurred in connection with onboard and other revenue . these include costs incurred in connection with shore excursions , beverage sales and gaming . payroll and related consists of the cost of wages and benefits for shipboard employees and costs for a third party that provides crew and other services for certain of our ships . fuel includes fuel costs , the impact of certain fuel hedges and fuel delivery costs . food consists of food costs for passengers and crew . other consists of repairs and maintenance ( including dry-dock costs ) , ship insurance , charter costs and other ship expenses . critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with u.s. gaap . the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates , judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the periods presented . we rely on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances to make these estimates and judgments . actual results could differ materially from these estimates . we believe that the following critical accounting policies reflect the significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements . these critical accounting policies , which are presented in detail in our notes to our audited consolidated financial statements , relate to ship accounting , asset impairment and contingencies . ship accounting ships represent our most significant assets , and we record them at cost less accumulated depreciation . depreciation of ships is computed on a straight-line basis over the estimated service lives of primarily 30 years after a 15 % reduction for the estimated residual value of the ship . improvement costs that we believe add value to our ships are capitalized to the ship and depreciated over the improvements ' estimated useful lives . repairs and maintenance activities are charged to expense as incurred . we account for dry-dock costs under the direct expense method which requires us to expense all dry-dock costs as incurred . we determine the useful life of our ships based primarily on our estimates of the average useful life of the ships ' major component systems , such as cabins , main diesels , main electric , superstructure and hull . in addition , we consider the impact of anticipated changes in the vacation market and technological conditions and historical useful lives of similarly-built ships . given the large and complex nature of our ships , our accounting estimates related to ships and determinations of ship improvement costs to be capitalized require considerable judgment and are inherently uncertain . should certain factors or circumstances cause us to revise our estimate of ship service lives or projected residual values , depreciation expense could be materially lower or higher . if circumstances cause us to change our assumptions in making determinations as to whether ship improvements should be capitalized , the amounts we expense each year as repairs and maintenance costs could increase , partially offset by a decrease in depreciation expense . if we reduced our estimated average 30-year ship service life by one year , depreciation expense for the year ended december 31 , 2014 would have 39 increased by $ 7.3 million . in addition , if our ships were estimated to have no residual value , depreciation expense for the same period would have increased by $ 36.5 million . we believe our estimates for ship accounting are reasonable and our methods are consistently applied . we believe that depreciation expense is based on a rational and systematic method to allocate our ships ' costs to the periods that benefit from the ships ' usage . asset impairment we review our long-lived assets , principally ships , for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable . assets are grouped and evaluated at the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets . we consider historical performance and future estimated results in our evaluation of potential impairment and then compare the carrying amount of the asset to the estimated future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset . if the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the estimated expected undiscounted future cash flows , we measure the amount of the impairment by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to its fair value . we estimate fair value based on the best information available making whatever estimates , judgments and projections considered necessary . story_separator_special_tag our non-gaap financial measures may not be comparable to other companies . please see a historical reconciliation of these measures to the most comparable gaap measure presented in our consolidated financial statements below in the

","results of operations overview the following discussion and analysis is designed to provide a better understanding of the significant changes and trends related to the company and the bank 's financial condition , operating results , asset and liability management , liquidity and capital resources and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of the company and the related notes at item 8 of this report . following is a summary of the components of net income for the periods indicated ( dollars in thousands ) : replace_table_token_4_th net interest income the company 's primary source of revenue is net interest income , which is the difference between interest income on earning assets and interest expense on interest-bearing liabilities . following is a summary of the company 's net interest income for the periods indicated ( dollars in thousands ) : replace_table_token_5_th net interest income ( fte ) for the year ended december 31 , 2011 was $ 93,053,000 , an increase of $ 2,201,000 or 2.4 % compared to the year ended december 31 , 2010. the increase in net interest income during 2011 when compared to 2010 is mainly due to the acquisition of citizens on september 23 , 2011 and its associated net interest income of $ 6,117,000 from september 23 , 2011 to december 31 , 2011. included in the net interest income associated with the citizens acquisition is $ 3,146,000 from the accretion of loan purchase discounts . also contributing to the increase in net interest income was a reduction in deposit rates and the flow of deposits from relatively higher paying time deposits to lower paying non-maturity deposits .

"the cost of patents is amortized over their useful lives . the cost of patents in process is not amortized until issuance . the company periodically obtains intellectual property rights , in the ordinary course of business , and the cost of the rights are amortized over their useful lives . goodwill and intangible assets goodwill reflects the cost of an acquisition in excess of the fair values assigned to identifiable net assets acquired . the company reviews goodwill for impairment during the fourth quarter on an annual basis or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that goodwill might be impaired . the company performs an impairment review for its automotive reporting unit , which has been determined to be one of the company 's reportable segments , using either a qualitative approach or quantitative approach which utilizes 48 gentex corporation and subsidiaries notes to consolidated financial statements ( continued ) ( 1 ) summary of significant accounting and reporting policies , continued a fair value method that incorporates certain assumptions and judgments . the fair value of a reporting unit refers to the price that would be received to sell the unit as a whole in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date . the company performs a qualitative assessment ( step 0 ) to determine whether it is more likely than not that a reporting unit 's fair value is less than its carrying amount . if not , no further goodwill impairment testing is performed . if so , we determine the fair value of the reporting unit . if the fair value of the reporting unit is greater than its carrying amount , goodwill is not considered to be impaired . however , if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount , an impairment change is recorded as the excess of the reporting units carrying value over its fair value . the assumptions included in the impairment tests require judgment and changes to these inputs could impact the results of the calculations which could result in an impairment charge in future periods if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its calculated fair value . for the qualitative assessment performed , management considers factors such as macro-economic conditions , industry and market considerations , overall financial performance , and other company-specific events , amongst other factors , in making the determination as to whether it is more likely than not that a reporting unit 's fair value is less than its carrying amount . other than management 's internal projections of future cash flows , the primary assumptions used in the step 1 and step 2 impairment tests are the weighted-average cost of capital and long-term growth rates . although the company 's cash flow forecasts are based on assumptions that are considered reasonable by management and consistent with the plans and estimates management is using to operate the

decreased by $ 173.7 million to $ 77.7 million , compared to the year ended december 31 , 2016 , primarily due to decreased investment purchases and capital expenditures during the year , as a result of allocation of funds to repay the long-term debt and for common stock repurchases . capital expenditures for the year ended december 31 , 2018 , were $ 86.0 million , compared with $ 104.0 million for the prior year , primarily due to decreases in production equipment purchases and building related costs . story_separator_special_tag given the current revenue forecast and projected product mix for 2019 , the company believes it may be able to offset some of those annual customer price reductions with purchasing cost reductions and operational efficiencies , but will be limited in certain aspects due to rising commodity costs on certain electronic components and precious metal commodities , in addition to the aforementioned increased costs related to tariffs . the company also currently estimates that its operating expenses , which include engineering , research and development expenses and selling , general and administrative expenses are expected to be between $ 195 and $ 200 million for calendar year 2019 , increased staffing levels which continue to support growth and launch of new business as well as development of new products . the company is a technology leader in the automotive industry , with a focus on developing uniquely designed solutions that are highly proprietary . the company continues to make investments to maintain a competitive advantage in its current market as well as to use its core competencies to develop products that are applicable in other markets . in light of on-going demand for our automatic-dimming mirrors and electronics , the

year 2019 are currently anticipated to be financed from current cash and cash equivalents on hand and cash flows from operating activities . 21 the company also estimates that depreciation and amortization expense for calendar year 2019 will be approximately $ 105 - $ 115 million . the company is further estimating that its tax rate will be between 16.0 % and 18.0 % for calendar year 2019. in accordance with its previously announced share repurchase plan and capital allocation strategy , the company intends to continue to repurchase additional shares of its common stock in 2019 and into the future depending on a number of factors , including : market , economic , and industry conditions ; the market price of the company 's common stock ; anti-dilutive effect on earnings ; available

is subject to market risk exposures of varying correlations and volatilities , including foreign exchange rate risk , and interest rate risk . fluctuating interest rates could negatively impact the company 's financial performance due to realized losses on the sale of fixed income investments and or recognized losses due to other-than-temporary impairment adjustments on held-to-maturity securities ( mark-to-market adjustments ) . the company has some assets , liabilities and operations outside the united states , including multi-currency accounts , which currently are not significant overall to the company as a whole . because the company sells its automotive mirrors throughout the world and automobile manufacturing is highly dependent on general economic conditions , it could be significantly affected by weak economic conditions in foreign markets that could reduce demand for its products . most of the company 's non-u.s. sales are invoiced and paid in u.s. dollars ; during calendar year 2018 , approximately 8 % of the company 's net sales were invoiced and paid in foreign currencies ( compared to 8 % for calendar year 2017 and 7 % for calendar year 2016 ) . the company

our evaluation of trends in the industry , information provided by our customers and suppliers and information available from other outside sources , as appropriate . however , these estimates and

operating activities was $ 739,066 during 2015 compared to net cash used in operating activities of $ 2,481,551 for 2014. the period to period change was primarily attributable to a decrease in net

in fiscal 2018 , due mainly to product mix shift and promotion optimization . the prepared food & fountain revenue less related cost of goods sold ( exclusive of depreciation and amortization ) increased to 62.2 % from 61.0 % during fiscal 2019 , due mainly to strategic price increases , favorable commodity prices , and a product mix shift . operating expenses increased 8.4 % ( $ 108,233 ) in fiscal 2019 primarily due to operating 73 more stores than one year ago . the majority of all operating expenses are wages and wage-related costs . depreciation and amortization expense increased $ 23,417 ( 10.6 % ) to $ 244,387 in fiscal 2019 from $ 220,970 in fiscal 2018 . the increase was due primarily to capital expenditures made in fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2018 . the effective tax rate increased to 22.6 % in fiscal 2019 from ( 48.3 ) % in fiscal 2018 . the increase in the effective tax rate was primarily due to the one-time benefit of the adoption of the 2017 tax cuts and jobs act ( `` tax reform act '' ) in the prior year . net income decreased to $ 203,886 in fiscal 2019 from $ 317,903 in fiscal 2018 . the decrease was mainly due to the adoption of the tax reform act , which amounted to approximately $ 173,000 of income upon adoption . this was offset by margin increases in each category in fiscal 2019 , operating 73 more stores than one year ago , and improved same store sales metrics inside the store . fiscal 2018 compared with fiscal 2017 total revenue for fiscal 2018 increased 11.8 % ( $ 884,537 ) to $ 8,391,124 , primarily due to a 9.3 % increase in the price of fuel ( which generated an additional $ 411,656 ) and number of fuel gallons sold ( which generated an additional $ 320,204 ) , and a $ 148,989 increase in inside sales ( grocery & other merchandise and prepared food & fountain ) . retail fuel sales for the fiscal year were $ 5,145,988 , an increase of 16.6 % . fuel gallons sold increased 6.6 % to 2.2 billion gallons . inside sales increased 4.9 % to $ 3,189,768 , primarily as a result of a $ 101,953 increase from stores that were built or acquired after april 30 , 2016 , and a $ 22,366 increase from the rollout and expansion of our operating programs in our stores ( expanded hours at select locations , stores with pizza delivery , and major remodels ) . total revenue less cost of goods sold ( excluding depreciation and amortization ) was

48.3 ) % in fiscal 2018 from 34.2 % in fiscal 2017 . the decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily due to the revaluation of net deferred tax liabilities as of the enactment date of the tax reform act along with a reduction in the federal corporate tax rate from 35 % to 30.4 % ( represents a blended rate as four months of our fiscal year are impacted by the new legislation ) on our current fiscal year earnings . 20 net income increased to $ 317,903 in fiscal 2018 from $ 177,485 in fiscal 2017 . the increase was due to a combination of the adoption of the tax reform act , an increase in the number of gallons sold , and slight increases in fuel margin and grocery margin . these were offset by a weaker agricultural economy , which has slowed the growth in customer traffic to stores , particularly inside the store combined with decreases in prepared food and fountain margins and unusual weather patterns compared to prior year . company total revenue and revenue less

management 's estimate of the future cash flows to be generated and the amount that could be realized from the sale of assets in a current transaction between willing parties , which are considered level 3 inputs ( see note 3 to the consolidated financial statements ) . the estimate is derived from offers , actual sale or disposition of assets subsequent to year-end , and other indications of fair value . in determining whether an asset is impaired , assets are grouped at the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets , which for the company is generally on a store-by-store basis . the company recorded impairment charges of $ 1,167 in fiscal 2019 , $ 507 in fiscal 2018 , and $ 705 in fiscal 2017 , a portion of which was related to replacement store and acquisition activities . impairment charges are a component of operating expenses . self-insurance we are primarily self-insured for employee healthcare , workers ' compensation , general liability , and automobile claims . the self-insurance claim liability for workers ' compensation , general liability , and automobile claims is determined actuarially at each year-end based on claims filed and an estimate of claims incurred but not yet reported . actuarial projections of the losses are employed due to the potential of variability in the liability estimates . some factors affecting the uncertainty of claims include the development time frame , settlement patterns , litigation and adjudication direction , and medical treatment and cost trends . the liability is not discounted . the balances of our self-insurance reserves were $ 44,334 and $ 39,777 for the years ended april 30 , 2019 and 2018 , respectively . 23 recent accounting pronouncements in may 2014 , the fasb issued accounting standards update ( asu ) no . 2014-09 , revenue from contracts with customers ( topic 606 ) . we adopted the standard on may 1 , 2018 using the modified retrospective approach . the company adopted two changes that affect the timing of recognition of revenues related to gift card breakage income and the redemption of coupon box tops attached to our pizza boxes . the impact related to gift cards was $ 879 , net of $ 321 of deferred taxes and was an increase to shareholders ' equity with a reduction in deferred income . the impact related to box tops was $ 5,019 , net of $ 1,816 of deferred taxes and was a reduction in shareholders ' equity , with an increase in deferred income . in february 2016 , the fasb issued asu 2016-02 , leases ( topic 842 ) . this update seeks to increase the transparency and comparability among entities by requiring public entities to recognize lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet and disclose key information about leasing arrangements . to satisfy the standard 's objective , a lessee will recognize a right-of-use asset representing its right to use the underlying asset for the lease term and a lease liability for the obligation to make lease payments . both the right-of-use asset and lease liability will initially be measured at the present value of the lease payments , with subsequent measurement dependent on the classification of the lease as either a finance or an operating lease . for leases with a term of twelve months or less , a lessee is permitted to make an accounting policy election by class of underlying asset not to recognize lease assets and lease liabilities . if a lessee makes this election , it should recognize lease expense for such leases generally on a straight-line basis over the lease term . in july 2018 , the fasb issued asu 2018-10 , leases ( topic 842 ) - codification improvements , which contains several fasb codification improvements for asc topic 842 , including several implementation issues and asu 2018-11 , `` leases ( topic 842 ) - targeted improvements '' which provides entities with an additional transition method for implementing asc topic 842. entities have the option to apply the new standard at the adoption date , recognizing a cumulative-effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings along with the modified retrospective approach previously identified , both of which include a number of practical expedients that companies may elect to apply . under the cumulative-effect adjustment comparative periods would not be restated . under the modified retrospective approach leases are recognized and measured under the noted guidance at the beginning of the earliest period presented . the new standard is effective for public companies for annual periods beginning after december 15 , 2018 , and interim periods within those years , with early adoption permitted . we will adopt this guidance as of may 1 , 2019 using the modified retrospective approach and elect the cumulative-effect adjustment practical expedient . as a result of the transition method selected , the company will not restate previously reported comparable periods . the effect of the adoption will not be material to our financial statements . in october 2016 , the fasb issued asu no . 2016-16 , intra-entity transfers of assets other than inventory . we adopted the standard in the quarter ended july 31 , 2018. there was no material impact to the company for the adoption of this standard . in january 2017 , the fasb issued asu 2017-01 , business combinations , clarifying the definition of a business . the standard clarifies the definition of a business and adds guidance to assist entities in the determination of whether an acquisition ( or disposal ) represents assets or a business . the guidance requires the company to utilize various criteria to evaluate whether or not an acquisition is a

, 2021 ( the trust has no directors or executive officers . ) 47 story_separator_special_tag trustee 's discussion and analysis for the three-year period ended december 31 , 2020 liquidity and capital resources as stipulated in the trust agreement , the trust is intended to be passive in nature and the trustee does not have any control over or any responsibility relating to the operation of the underlying properties . the trustee has powers to collect and distribute proceeds received by the trust and pay trust liabilities and expenses and its actions have been limited to those activities . the trust is a passive entity and other than the trust 's ability to periodically borrow money as necessary to pay expenses , liabilities and obligations of the trust that can not be paid out of cash held by the trust , the trust is prohibited from engaging in borrowing transactions . as a result , other than such borrowings , if any , the trust has no source of liquidity or capital resources other than the royalties . story_separator_special_tag text-indent:4 % ; font-size:10pt ; font-family : arial '' > royalty income for the trust for the fourth quarter is associated with actual oil and gas production during august through october from the underlying properties . story_separator_special_tag oil and gas production attributable to the underlying properties for the quarter and the comparable period for 2019 are as follows : replace_table_token_12_th the posted price of oil decreased for the fourth quarter of 2020 compared to the fourth quarter of 2019 , resulting in an average price per barrel of $ 37.91 compared to $ 53.22 in the same period of 2019. the average price of gas decreased for the fourth quarter of 2020 compared to the same period in 2019 , resulting in an average price per mcf of $ 2.14 compared to $ 2.70 in the fourth quarter of 2019. the trustee has been advised that oil production decreased in the fourth quarter of 2020 compared to the same period in 2019 primarily due to natural decline . gas production increased in the fourth quarter of 2020 compared to the same period in 2019 due to additional wells producing later in the year due to new drilling . the trust has been advised that 6 wells were drilled and completed during the three months ended december 31 , 2020 , and there were 7 wells in progress . use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with the basis of accounting described above requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts of certain assets , liabilities , revenues and expenses as of and for the reporting periods . actual results may differ from such estimates . 28 impairment the trustee routinely reviews its royalty interests in oil and gas properties for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable . if an impairment event occurs and it is determined that the carrying value of the trust 's royalty interests may not be recoverable , an impairment will be recognized as measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the royalty interests exceeds the fair value of these assets , which would likely be measured by discounting projected cash flows . there was no impairment of the assets as of december 31 , 2020. critical accounting policies and estimates the trust 's financial statements reflect the selection and application of accounting policies that require the trust to make significant estimates and assumptions . the following are some of the more critical judgment areas in the application of accounting policies that currently affect the trust 's financial condition and results of operations . 1. basis of accounting the financial statements of the trust are prepared on the following basis : royalty income recorded for a month is the amount computed and paid to the trustee on behalf of the trust by the interest owners . royalty income consists of the amounts received by the owners of the interest burdened by the royalties from the sale of production less accrued production costs , development and drilling costs , applicable taxes , operating charges and other costs and deductions multiplied by 75 % in the case of the waddell ranch properties and 95 % in the case of the texas royalty properties . trust expenses , consisting principally of routine general and administrative costs , recorded are based on liabilities paid and cash reserves established out of cash received or borrowed funds for liabilities and contingencies . distributions to unit holders are recorded when declared by the trustee . royalty income is computed separately for each of the conveyances under which the royalties were conveyed to the trust . if monthly costs exceed revenues for any conveyance ( excess costs ) , such excess costs can not reduce royalty income from other conveyances , but is carried forward with accrued interest to be recovered from future net proceeds of that conveyance . the financial statements of the trust differ from financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america ( gaap ) because revenues are not accrued in the month of production and certain cash reserves may be established for contingencies which would not be accrued in financial statements prepared in accordance with gaap . amortization of the royalties calculated on a unit-of-production basis is charged directly to trust corpus . this comprehensive basis of accounting other than gaap corresponds to the accounting permitted for royalty trusts by the sec as specified by staff accounting bulletin topic 12 : e , financial statements of royalty trusts . 2. royalty income revenues from royalty interests are recognized in the period in which amounts are received by the trust . royalty income received by the trust in a given calendar year will generally reflect the proceeds from crude oil and natural gas produced for the twelve-month period ended october 31 st in that calendar year . 3. reserve disclosure independent petroleum engineers estimate the net proved reserves attributable to the royalty interests . estimates of future net revenues from proved reserves have been prepared using average 12-month oil and gas prices , determined 29 as an unweighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month benchmark price for each month within the 12-month period preceding the end of the most recent fiscal year , unless prices are defined by contractual arrangements . the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows is achieved by using a discount rate of 10 % a year to reflect the timing of future cash flows relating to proved oil and gas reserves . the reserves actually recovered and the timing of production may be substantially different from the reserve estimates and related costs . numerous uncertainties are inherent in estimating volumes and the value of proved reserves and in projecting future production rates and the timing of development of non-producing reserves . such reserve estimates are subject to change as market conditions change . detailed information concerning the number of wells on royalty properties is not generally available to the owner of royalty interests . consequently , the registrant does not have information that would be disclosed
","results of operations royalty income received by the trust for the three-year period ended december 31 , 2020 , is reported in the following table : replace_table_token_10_th royalty income of the trust for the calendar year is associated with actual oil and gas production for the period november of the prior year through october of the current year . oil and gas production for 2020 , 2019 and 2018 generated by the royalties and the underlying properties , excluding portions attributable to the adjustments discussed hereafter , are presented in the following table : replace_table_token_11_th the average price of oil decreased to $ 39.51 per barrel in 2020 , down from $ 51.74 per barrel in 2019. the average price of oil in 2018 was $ 58.11 per barrel . in addition , the average price of gas decreased from $ 2.64 per mcf in 2019 to $ 1.47 per mcf in 2020. the average price of gas in 2018 was $ 3.55 per mcf . oil prices have decreased primarily because of world market conditions and the negative impact of the covid-19 pandemic on economic activity . oil prices are expected to remain volatile . gas liquids values remain weaker and keep the prices of gas weaker in addition to not receiving revenue from blackbeard on the waddell npi due to excess costs of new drilling . 26 subsequent to december 31 , 2020 , the price of both oil and gas continued to fluctuate , giving rise to a correlating adjustment of the respective standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows . as of march 10 , 2021 , nymex posted oil prices were approximately $ 64.75 per barrel , which compared to the posted price of $ 39.57 per barrel , used to calculate the worth of future net revenue of the trust 's proved developed reserves , would result in a smaller standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows for oil .

"( 4 ) the efficiency ratio is calculated by dividing total non-interest expense by tax-equivalent net revenues ( less securities gains or losses ) . a lower ratio indicates more efficient revenue generation . ( 5 ) the allowance for credit losses includes both the allowance for loan losses and the allowance for lending-related commitments , but excludes the allowance for covered loan losses . ( 6 ) total shareholders ' equity minus preferred stock and total intangible assets divided by total assets minus total intangible assets . please refer to the consolidated results of operations section later in this discussion for an analysis of the company 's operations for the past three years . replace_table_token_49_th non-gaap financial measures/ratios the accounting and reporting policies of wintrust conform to generally accepted accounting principles ( “ gaap ” ) in the united states and prevailing practices in the banking industry . however , certain non-gaap performance measures and ratios are used by management to evaluate and measure the company 's performance . these include taxable-equivalent net interest income ( including its individual components ) , net interest margin ( including its individual components ) , the efficiency ratio , tangible common equity ratio , tangible common book value per share and return on average tangible common equity . in addition , certain operating measures and ratios are adjusted for acquisition and non-operating compensation charges . these operating measures and ratios include operating net income , the efficiency ratio , the net overhead ratio , return on average assets , return on average common equity , return on average tangible common equity and net income per diluted common share . management believes that these measures and ratios provide users of the company 's financial information a more meaningful view of the performance of the interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities and of the company 's operating efficiency . other financial holding companies may define or calculate these measures and ratios differently . management reviews yields on certain asset categories and the net interest margin of the company and its banking subsidiaries on a fully taxable-equivalent ( “ fte ” ) basis . in this non-gaap presentation , net interest income is adjusted to reflect tax-exempt interest income on an equivalent before-tax basis . this measure ensures comparability of net interest income arising from both taxable and tax-exempt sources . net interest income on a fte basis is also used in the calculation of the company 's efficiency ratio . the efficiency ratio , which is calculated by dividing non-interest expense by total taxable-equivalent net revenue ( less securities gains or losses ) , measures how much it costs to produce one dollar of revenue . securities gains or losses are excluded from this calculation to better match revenue from daily operations to operational expenses . management considers the tangible common equity ratio and tangible book value per common share as useful measurements of the company 's equity . the company references the return on average tangible common equity as a measurement of profitability . management considers operating net income , which is reported net income excluding acquisition and non-operating compensation charges , as a useful measure of operating performance . acquisition related charges are specific costs incurred by the company as a result of an acquisition that are not expected to continue in subsequent periods . non-operating compensation charges are certain salary and employee benefit costs incurred that are not related to current operating services provided by employees of the company . the company excludes acquisition and non-operating compensation charges from reported net income as well as certain operating measures and ratios noted above to provide better comparability between periods . replace_table_token_50_th the following table presents a reconciliation of certain non-gaap performance measures and ratios used by the company to evaluate and measure the company 's performance to the most directly comparable gaap financial measures for the last five years . replace_table_token_51_th replace_table_token_52_th replace_table_token_53_th ( 1 ) the company considers acquisition and non-operating compensation charges incurred prior to 2015 to be insignificant . replace_table_token_54_th overview and strategy 2015 highlights the company recorded net income of $ 156.7 million for the year of 2015 compared to $ 151.4 million and $ 137.2 million for the years of 2014 and 2013 , respectively . the results for 2015 demonstrate continued operating strengths including strong loan and deposit growth driving higher net interest income , increased mortgage banking revenue , higher fees from covered call options and customer interest rate swaps and stable credit quality metrics . the company increased its loan portfolio , excluding covered loans , from $ 14.4 billion at december 31 , 2014 to $ 17.1 billion at december 31 , 2015 . this increase was primarily a result of the company 's commercial banking initiative , growth in the commercial real estate and life insurance premium finance receivables portfolios and acquisitions during the period . the company is focused on making new loans , including in the commercial and commercial real estate sector , where opportunities that meet our underwriting standards exist . for more information regarding changes in the company 's loan portfolio , see “ analysis of financial condition – interest earning assets ” and note 4 “ loans ” of the consolidated financial statements presented under item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k. management considers the maintenance of adequate liquidity to be important to the management of risk . accordingly , during 2015 , the company continued its practice of maintaining appropriate funding capacity to provide the company with adequate liquidity for its ongoing operations . in this regard , the company benefited from its strong deposit base , a liquid short-term investment portfolio and its access to funding from a variety of external funding sources including the issuance of the series d preferred stock ( as defined below ) in 2015. at december 31 , 2015 , the company had overnight liquid funds and interest-bearing deposits with banks of $ 883.6 million compared to $ 1.2 billion at december 31 , 2014 . story_separator_special_tag for more information see note 20 “ derivative financial instruments ” of the consolidated financial statements presented under item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k. the interest rate environment impacts the profitability and mix of the company 's mortgage banking business which generated revenues of $ 115.0 million in 2015 and $ 91.6 million in 2014 , representing 13 % of total net revenue in 2015 and 11 % in 2014. mortgage banking revenue is primarily comprised of gains on sales of mortgage loans originated for new home purchases as well as mortgage refinancing . mortgage banking revenue is partially offset by corresponding commission and overhead costs . mortgage originations totaled $ 3.9 billion and $ 3.2 billion in 2015 and 2014 , respectively . in 2015 , approximately 61 % of originations were mortgages associated with new home purchases while 39 % of originations were related to refinancing of mortgages . assuming the housing market continues to improve and interest rates rise , we expect a higher percentage of originations to be attributed to new home purchases . non-interest expense management believes expense management is important amid the low interest rate environment and increased competition to enhance profitability . cost control and an efficient infrastructure should position the company appropriately as it continues its growth strategy . management continues to be disciplined in its approach to growth and plans to leverage the company 's existing expense infrastructure to expand its presence in existing and complimentary markets . potentially impacting the cost control strategies discussed above , the company anticipates increased costs resulting from the changing regulatory environment in which we operate . we have already experienced increases in compliance-related costs and we expect that compliance with the dodd-frank act and its implementing regulations will require us to invest significant additional management attention and resources . credit quality the company 's credit quality metrics remained relatively stable in 2015 compared to 2014. the company continues to actively address non-performing assets and remains disciplined in its approach to grow without sacrificing asset quality . management primarily reviews credit quality excluding covered loans as those loans are obtained through fdic-assisted acquisitions and therefore potential credit losses are subject to indemnification by the fdic . in particular : the company 's 2015 provision for credit losses , excluding covered loans , totaled $ 33.7 million , compared to $ 22.9 million in 2014 and $ 46.0 million in 2013 . net charge-offs , excluding covered loans , decreased to $ 19.2 million in 2015 ( of which $ 6.5 million related to commercial and commercial real estate loans ) , compared to $ 27.2 million in 2014 ( of which $ 17.4 million related to commercial and commercial real estate loans ) and $ 56.1 million in 2013 ( of which $ 42.7 million related to commercial and commercial real estate loans ) . replace_table_token_56_th the company 's allowance for loan losses , excluding covered loans , increased to $ 105.4 million at december 31 , 2015 , reflecting an increase of $ 13.7 million , or 15 % , when compared to 2014 . at december 31 , 2015 , approximately $ 43.8 million , or 42 % , of the allowance for loan losses , excluding covered loans , was associated with commercial real estate loans and another $ 36.1 million , or 34 % , was associated with commercial loans . the company has significant exposure to commercial real estate . at december 31 , 2015 , $ 5.5 billion , or 32 % , of our loan portfolio , excluding covered loans , was commercial real estate , with more than 91 % located in our market area . the commercial real estate loan portfolio , excluding purchased credit impaired ( `` pci '' ) loans , was comprised of $ 437.1 million related to land , residential and commercial construction , $ 863.0 million related to office buildings loans , $ 868.4 million related to retail loans , $ 727.6 million related to industrial use , $ 742.3 million related to multi-family loans and $ 1.7 billion related to mixed use and other use types . in analyzing the commercial real estate market , the company does not rely upon the assessment of broad market statistical data , in large part because the company 's market area is diverse and covers many communities , each of which is impacted differently by economic forces affecting the company 's general market area . as such , the extent of the decline in real estate valuations can vary meaningfully among the different types of commercial and other real estate loans made by the company . the company uses its multi-chartered structure and local management knowledge to analyze and manage the local market conditions at each of its banks . as of december 31 , 2015 , the company had approximately $ 26.6 million of non-performing commercial real estate loans representing approximately 0.5 % of the total commercial real estate loan portfolio . total non-performing loans ( loans on non-accrual status and loans more than 90 days past due and still accruing interest ) , excluding covered loans , were $ 84.1 million ( of which $ 26.6 million , or 32 % , was related to commercial real estate ) at december 31 , 2015 , an increase of $ 5.4 million compared to december 31 , 2014 . the company 's other real estate owned , excluding covered other real estate owned , decreased by $ 1.7 million , to $ 43.9 million during 2015 , from $ 45.6 million at december 31 , 2014 . the decrease in other real estate owned is primarily a result of disposals during 2015. the $ 43.9 million of other real estate owned as of december 31 , 2015 was comprised of $ 29.7 million of commercial real estate property , $ 11.3 million of residential real estate property and $ 2.9 million of residential real estate development property .
","operating segment results as described in note 23 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 , the company 's operations consist of three primary segments : community banking , specialty finance and wealth management . the company 's profitability is primarily dependent on the net interest income , provision for credit losses , non-interest income and operating expenses of its community banking segment . for purposes of internal segment profitability , management allocates certain intersegment and parent company balances . management allocates a portion of revenues to the specialty finance segment related to loans originated by the specialty finance segment and sold to the community banking segment . similarly , for purposes of analyzing the contribution from the wealth management segment , management allocates a portion of the net interest income earned by the community banking segment on deposit balances of customers of the wealth management segment to the wealth management segment . finally , expenses incurred at the wintrust parent company are allocated to each segment based on each segment 's risk-weighted assets . the community banking segment 's net interest income for the year ended december 31 , 2015 totaled $ 523.1 million as compared to $ 484.5 million for the same period in 2014 , an increase of $ 38.6 million , or 8 % , and the segment 's net interest income in 2014 compared to 2013 increased $ 36.3 million or 8 % . the increases in 2015 compared to 2014 as well as 2014 compared to 2013 were primarily attributable to an increase in earning assets including those acquired in bank acquisitions . the community banking segment 's provision for credit losses totaled $ 29.7 million in 2015 compared to $ 17.7 million in 2014 and $ 45.4 million in 2013 .

"the company has recognized a current asset for this amount , and has recognized an unrealized gain of $ 0.3 million , net of income taxes of $ 0.2 million , which is included in other comprehensive income . the following table summarizes the changes in the fair values of derivative story_separator_special_tag the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our selected historical consolidated financial data and our accompanying consolidated financial statements and the notes to those financial statements included elsewhere in this report . the following discussion includes forward-looking statements that reflect our plans , estimates and beliefs . our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in these forward-looking statements . factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include , but are not limited to , those discussed below and elsewhere in this report , particularly in risk factors and cautionary note regarding forward-looking statements. overview we are an independent energy company engaged in the acquisition , exploration , development and production of oil and natural gas in the united states . we own interests in 1,711 producing oil and natural gas wells ( 925.6 net to us ) and we operate 974 of these wells . in managing our business , we are concerned primarily with maximizing return on our stockholders ' equity . to accomplish this goal , we focus on profitably increasing our oil and natural gas reserves and production . our future growth will be driven primarily by acquisition , development and exploration activities . in 2011 our growth in production and proved reserves was primarily driven by our successful drilling activities in the haynesville/bossier shale and eagle ford shale formations and the acquisitions we completed in 2011. under our current drilling budget , we plan to spend approximately $ 458.0 million in 2012 for development and exploration activities which will primarily be focused on oil by developing our delaware basin properties in west texas and our eagle ford shale properties in south texas . we plan to drill 84 wells ( 60.6 net to us ) in 2012 of which 43 wells will be in the delaware basin , 24 will be horizontal eagle ford shale wells and 17 will be haynesville or bossier shale wells . however , we could increase or decrease the number of wells that we drill depending on oil and natural gas prices . we do not specifically budget for acquisitions as the timing and size of acquisitions are not predictable . 43 we use the successful efforts method of accounting , which allows only for the capitalization of costs associated with developing proven oil and natural gas properties as well as exploration costs associated with successful exploration activities . accordingly , our exploration costs consist of costs we incur to acquire and reprocess 3-d seismic data , impairments of our unevaluated leasehold where we were not successful in discovering reserves and the costs of unsuccessful exploratory wells that we drill . we generally sell our oil and natural gas at current market prices at the point our wells connect to third party purchaser pipelines . we have entered into certain gathering and treating agreements with midstream companies to transport a substantial portion of our natural gas production in north louisiana , to long-haul gas pipelines . in addition , we have also entered into agreements for firm transportation of 80,000 mmbtus per day of natural gas on long-haul pipelines . we market our products several different ways depending upon a number of factors , including the availability of purchasers for the product , the availability and cost of pipelines near our wells , market prices , pipeline constraints and operational flexibility . accordingly , our revenues are heavily dependent upon the prices of , and demand for , oil and natural gas . oil and natural gas prices have historically been volatile and are likely to remain volatile in the future . our operating costs are generally comprised of several components , including costs of field personnel , insurance , repair and maintenance costs , production supplies , fuel used in operations , transportation costs , workover expenses and state production and ad valorem taxes . like all oil and natural gas exploration and production companies , we face the constant challenge of replacing our reserves . although in the past we have offset the effect of declining production rates from existing properties through successful acquisition and drilling efforts , there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to offset production declines or maintain production at current rates through future acquisitions or drilling activity . our future growth will depend on our ability to continue to add new reserves in excess of production . our operations and facilities are subject to extensive federal , state and local laws and regulations relating to the exploration for , and the development , production and transportation of , oil and natural gas , and operating safety . future laws or regulations , any adverse changes in the interpretation of existing laws and regulations or our failure to comply with existing legal requirements may have an adverse effect on our business , results of operations and financial condition . applicable environmental regulations require us to remove our equipment after production has ceased , to plug and abandon our wells and to remediate any environmental damage our operations may have caused . the present value of the estimated future costs to plug and abandon our oil and gas wells and to dismantle and remove our production facilities is included in our reserve for future abandonment costs , which was $ 14.0 million as of december 31 , 2011 . 44 story_separator_special_tag ( 2 ) represents depreciation , depletion and amortization of

decreased by $ 26.8 million from our cash from operating activities of $ 311.7 million in 2010 mainly due to changes in working capital at the end of 2011. cash flow from operations excluding changes in working capital accounts of $ 297.6 million in 2011 increased 35 % as compared to $ 219.7 million in 2010 due to the higher revenues we 48 received from increased production and higher oil prices . our cash flow from operating activities from operations in 2010 increased by $ 135.4 million to $ 311.7 million as compared to $ 176.3 million in 2009 primarily due to higher revenues which were mainly due to the higher oil and natural gas prices we realized in 2010. our primary need for capital , in addition to funding our ongoing operations , relates to the acquisition , development and exploration of our oil and gas properties and the repayment of our debt . during 2011 our capital expenditures of $ 1.0 billion increased by $ 502.0 million as compared to 2010 capital expenditures of $ 545.7 million due primarily to the $ 218.7 million spent to acquire proved oil and gas properties and $ 255.7 million to acquire unproved exploration acreage in 2011. capital expenditures in 2011 also include $ 129.5 million spent to complete wells drilled in 2010. in 2010 , our capital expenditures of $ 545.7 million increased by $ 200.9 million as compared to 2009 capital expenditures of $ 344.8 million . our annual capital expenditure activity is summarized in the following table : replace_table_token_17_th the timing of most of our capital expenditures is discretionary because we have no material long-term capital expenditure commitments except for contracted drilling and completion services . consequently , we have a significant degree of flexibility to adjust the level of our capital expenditures as circumstances warrant . we currently expect to spend approximately $ 458.0 million for development and exploration projects in 2012 , which will be funded primarily by cash flows from operating activities , proceeds from asset sales and borrowings under our credit facility . our operating cash flow and , therefore , our capital expenditures are highly dependent on oil and natural gas prices and , in particular , natural gas prices . we do not have a specific acquisition budget for 2012 because the timing and size of acquisitions are unpredictable . smaller acquisitions will generally be funded from operating cash flow . with respect to significant acquisitions , we intend to use borrowings under our bank credit facility , or other debt or equity financings to the extent available , to finance such acquisitions . the availability and attractiveness of these sources of financing will depend upon a number of factors , some of which will relate to our financial condition and performance and some of which will be beyond our control , such as prevailing interest rates , oil and natural gas prices and other market conditions . lack of access to the debt or equity markets due to general economic conditions could impede our ability to complete acquisitions . we have a $ 850.0 million bank credit facility with bank of montreal , as the administrative agent . the bank credit facility is a five-year revolving credit commitment that matures on november 30 , 2015. indebtedness under the bank credit facility is secured by all of our and our wholly owned subsidiaries ' assets and is guaranteed by all of our wholly owned subsidiaries . the bank credit facility is subject to borrowing base availability , which is redetermined semiannually based on the banks ' estimates of the 49 future net cash flows of our oil and natural gas properties . as of december 31 , 2011 , the borrowing base was $ 610.0 million , plus an additional $ 90.0 million available through december 31 , 2012 for a total of $ 700.0 million , $ 100.0 million of which was available . the borrowing base may be affected by the performance of our properties and changes in oil and natural gas prices . the determination of the borrowing base is at the sole discretion of the administrative agent and the bank group . borrowings under the bank credit facility bear interest , based on the utilization of the borrowing base , at our option at either ( 1 ) libor plus 1.75 % to 4.0 % or ( 2 ) the base rate ( which is the higher of the administrative agent 's prime rate , the federal funds rate plus 0.5 % or 30 day libor plus 1.0 % ) plus 0.75 % to 3.0 % . a commitment fee of 0.5 % is payable on the unused borrowing base . the bank credit facility contains covenants that , among other things , restrict the payment of cash dividends in excess of $ 50.0 million , limit the amount of consolidated debt that we may incur and limit our ability to make certain loans and investments . the only financial covenants are the maintenance of a ratio of current assets , including the availability under the bank credit facility , to current liabilities and maintenance of a leverage ratio . we were in compliance with these covenants as of december 31 , 2011. we have $ 300.0 million of 8 3 / 8 % senior notes outstanding which are due october 15 , 2017. interest is payable semiannually on each october 15 and april 15. we also have $ 300.0 million of 7 3 / 4 % senior notes outstanding which are due april 1 , 2019. interest is paid semiannually on each april 1 and october 1. the senior notes are unsecured obligations and are guaranteed by all of our material subsidiaries .
","results of operations year ended december 31 , 2011 compared to year ended december 31 , 2010 our operating data for 2010 and 2011 is summarized below : replace_table_token_15_th ( 1 ) includes ad valorem taxes . ( 2 ) represents depreciation , depletion and amortization of oil and gas properties only . oil and gas sales . our oil and gas sales increased $ 85.2 million ( 24 % ) in 2011 to $ 434.4 million from sales of $ 349.1 million in 2010. this increase resulted from higher natural gas production and higher prices realized for crude oil sales in 2011. our production in 2011 increased by 31 % over 2010 's production as our successful drilling in the haynesville/bossier and eagle ford shale formations exceeded declines from our existing producing properties . prices realized for crude oil sales increased by 40 % in 2011 as compared to 2010 while the average price we realized for natural gas sales decreased by 10 % in 2011 as compared to 2010. during 2011 we drilled 87 wells ( 47.7 net to us ) , 62 of which were haynesville or bossier shale horizontal wells and 20 of which were eagle ford shale horizontal wells . at december 31 , 2011 we had 23 wells ( 15.5 net to us ) that were drilled in 2011 awaiting completion . production taxes . production taxes decreased $ 6.2 million ( 63 % ) to $ 3.7 million in 2011 from $ 9.9 million in 2010. our haynesville and bossier shale wells , which comprise a large percentage of our production , qualify for exemption from certain state production taxes . the exempt wells together with the lower natural gas prices account for the decrease . gathering and transportation .

"the fair value of long-term debt is determined using current story_separator_special_tag general as of february 27 , 2012 we owned and operated 116 restaurants located in 13 states ( california , texas , arizona , colorado , oregon , nevada , florida , ohio , oklahoma , kentucky , indiana , louisiana and washington ) . each of our restaurants is operated either as a bj 's restaurant & brewery ® , a bj 's restaurant & brewhouse ® , a bj 's pizza & grill ® , or a bj 's grill restaurant . our menu features our award-winning , signature deep-dish pizza , our own proprietary handcrafted beers as well as a wide selection of appetizers , entrees , pastas , sandwiches , specialty salads , desserts , non-alcoholic beverages , wine , other craft beers and spirits . the first bj 's restaurant was opened in orange county , california in 1978 as a small full-service restaurant focusing on a lighter , bakery crust style deep-dish pizza . we acquired the original bj 's restaurants in 1995 from their original owners . our initial public offering of common stock occurred in 1996. additionally , in 1996 , we opened our first large-format restaurant and brewery in brea , california and began to expand the menu to include our own handcrafted beer , appetizers , entrees , pastas , sandwiches , specialty salads and desserts . of the 116 restaurants we operated as of february 27 , 2012 , 10 are bj 's restaurant & brewery ® restaurants ( of which three are currently manufacturing our proprietary handcrafted beer for some of our restaurants ) , 98 are bj 's restaurant & brewhouse ® restaurants ( which are similar to our brewery restaurants except that they do not manufacture beer ) , seven are bj 's pizza & grill ® restaurants ( which are primarily our original , smaller format legacy restaurants , of which one has an operating brewery ) and one is bj 's grill ( a smaller format full service restaurant intended to serve as a live research and development restaurant at the current time ) . in the near term , our future restaurant growth will focus principally on our bj 's restaurant & brewhouse ® format . however , we may continue to build additional bj 's restaurant & brewery ® locations in certain areas where we believe it may be more appropriate to brew our own beer . we may also consider opening smaller-format bj 's pizza & grill ® or bj 's grill formats as fill-in locations in certain densely-populated , urban trade areas , or in smaller cities , where a larger-format location could not be obtained or is not appropriate . we also have contract brewing arrangements in which we utilize other qualified craft brewers to produce our proprietary handcrafted beers and sodas under our proprietary recipes and our indirect supervision . we currently believe that , over the long run , it will become more beneficial to increase our contract brewing due to the economies of scale that can be obtained from brewing beer in large quantities while also avoiding potential liquor licensing complications in some states where we desire to operate 46 restaurants . as such , we expect to gradually increase our contract brewing relationships over the next several years . as a result of this expected increase in contract brewing , we intend to rebalance our internal beer production activities on an ongoing basis . in addition , we may decide to eventually decommission certain additional internally-operated breweries , which may result in additional disposals of related assets in the future . we intend to continue developing and opening new bj 's restaurants in high profile locations within densely populated areas in both existing and new markets . since most of our established restaurants currently operate close to full capacity during the peak demand periods of lunch and dinner , and given our relatively high average sales per productive square foot , we generally do not expect to achieve sustained increases in comparable sales in excess of our annual effective menu price increases for our mature restaurants , assuming we are able to retain our guest traffic levels in those restaurants . therefore , we currently expect that the majority of our year-over-year revenue growth for fiscal 2012 will be derived from new restaurant openings and the carryover impact of partial-year openings during 2011. newly opened restaurants typically experience normal inefficiencies in the form of higher cost of sales , labor and direct operating and occupancy costs for several months after their opening in both percentage and dollar terms when compared with our more mature , established restaurants . accordingly , the number and timing of newly opened restaurants has had , and is expected to continue to have , an impact on restaurant opening expenses , cost of sales , labor and occupancy and operating expenses . additionally , initial restaurant openings in new markets may experience even greater inefficiencies for several months , if not longer , due to lower initial sales volumes , which results from initially low consumer awareness levels , and a lack of supply chain and other operating cost leverage until additional restaurants can be opened in the markets . our revenues are comprised of food and beverage sales at our restaurants . revenues from restaurant sales are recognized when payment is tendered at the point of sale . revenues from our gift cards are recognized upon redemption in our restaurants . gift card breakage is recognized as other income on our consolidated statements of income . gift card breakage is recorded when the likelihood of the redemption of the gift cards becomes remote , which is typically after 24 months from original gift card issuance . cost of sales is comprised of food and beverage costs . the components of cost of sales are variable and typically fluctuate directly with sales volumes . story_separator_special_tag occupancy and operating . occupancy and operating expenses increased by $ 17.7 million , or 16.2 % , to $ 127.3 million during fiscal 2011 compared to $ 109.6 million during fiscal 2010. this increase was primarily due to the opening of 13 new restaurants during fiscal 2011 coupled with the impact of the 53 rd week . as a percentage of revenues , occupancy and operating expenses decreased to 20.5 % for fiscal 2011 from 21.3 % for the prior fiscal year . this percentage decrease was principally a result of our ability to leverage the fixed component of these expenses as a result of higher comparable sales . general and administrative . general and administrative expenses increased by $ 5.3 million , or 15.4 % , to $ 40.0 million during fiscal 2011 compared to $ 34.6 million during fiscal 2010. also included in general and 50 administrative costs for fiscal 2011 and 2010 was $ 3.0 million and $ 2.9 million , respectively , of stock-based compensation expense . the increase in general and administrative costs was primarily due to planned higher field supervision and support personnel , coupled with higher levels of recruiting and training costs related to our managers in training program , additional travel and lodging costs to support our new restaurant openings and the impact of the 53 rd week . as a percentage of revenues , general and administrative expenses decreased to 6.4 % for fiscal 2011 from 6.7 % for the prior fiscal year . this percentage decrease was due to our ability to leverage the fixed component of these expenses over a higher revenue base . depreciation and amortization . depreciation and amortization increased by $ 5.2 million , or 18.0 % , to $ 34.1 million during fiscal 2011 compared to $ 28.9 million during fiscal 2010. depreciation and amortization increased as a result of our construction costs for new restaurants and depreciation on our new operating toolsets , restaurant remodels and initiatives . as a percentage of revenues , depreciation and amortization slightly decreased to 5.5 % for fiscal 2011 from 5.6 % for the prior fiscal year . this percentage decrease was principally a result of our ability to leverage the fixed component of these expenses as a result of higher comparable sales . restaurant opening . restaurant opening expenses increased by $ 1.8 million , or 34.8 % , to $ 7.0 million during fiscal 2011 compared to $ 5.2 million during fiscal 2010. we opened 13 and 10 new restaurants during fiscal 2011 and 2010 , respectively . our opening costs will fluctuate from period to period , depending upon , but not limited to , the number of restaurant openings , the size and concept of the restaurants being opened , the location of the restaurants and the complexity of the staff hiring and training process . see business  restaurant opening expenses in part i , item 1 of this annual report on form 10-k. loss on disposal of assets . loss on disposal of assets decreased by $ 0.1 million , or 10.7 % , to $ 1.0 million during fiscal 2011 compared to $ 1.2 million during fiscal 2010. these costs were primarily related to the disposal of certain unproductive restaurant assets in connection with our ongoing productivity/efficiency initiatives and facility image enhancement activities . legal settlements . legal settlements of approximately $ 2.0 million or 0.3 % of revenues , during fiscal 2011 were primarily related to the proposed settlements of certain california employment practices lawsuits . we agreed to these settlements , which are subject to court approval , in order to avoid the costs , risks and uncertainties inherent in litigation and to eliminate the further diversion of company management 's time and attention , and without admitting any liability on the part of the company . see part i item 3  legal proceedings of this form 10-k for additional information regarding pending and recently settled legal proceedings . interest income . interest income increased by $ 0.1 million , or 87.9 % , to $ 0.2 million during fiscal 2011 compared to $ 0.1 million during fiscal 2010. this increase was primarily due to slightly higher interest rates and investment balances compared to last year . interest expense . interest expense increased by $ 0.05 million , or 60.0 % , to $ 0.1 million during fiscal 2011 compared to $ 0.09 million during fiscal 2010. this increase was primarily due to higher fees related to our letters of credit as compared to last year . gain ( loss ) on investment settlement . gain ( loss ) on investment settlement of approximately $ 0.6 million during fiscal 2011 relates to the settlement agreement reached in december 2009 with our former broker-dealer for the full liquidation of our auction rate securities investment portfolio . under the terms of the settlement agreement , we are entitled to potential future recoveries of our loss on that portfolio based on the performance of those auction rate securities through december 2012. in connection with this settlement , during fiscal 2011 certain of these aforementioned securities were redeemed at par , resulting in additional cash recoveries . other income , net . net other income consists primarily of gift card breakage income and remained stable at $ 0.6 million during fiscal 2011 compared to $ 0.6 million during fiscal 2010. based on an analysis of our gift card program since its inception , we determined that 24 months after issuance date , the likelihood of gift card redemption is remote . 51 income tax expense . our effective income tax rate for fiscal 2011 was 27.7 % compared to 24.8 % for fiscal 2010. the effective income tax rate for fiscal 2011 differed from the statutory income tax rate primarily due to additional tax credits .
","results of operations the following table sets forth , for the years indicated , our consolidated statements of income expressed as percentages of total revenues . fiscal 2011 consists of 53 weeks . all other fiscal years presented consist of 52 weeks . replace_table_token_6_th 53 weeks ended january 3 , 2012 ( fiscal 2011 ) compared to the 52 weeks ended december 28 , 2010 ( fiscal 2010 ) revenues . total revenues increased by $ 107.0 million , or 20.8 % , to $ 620.9 million during fiscal 2011 from $ 513.9 million during fiscal 2010. the increase in revenues consisted of an increase of approximately $ 62.0 million in sales from new restaurants not yet in our comparable sales base ; an approximate $ 31.1 million , or 6.6 % , increase in comparable restaurant sales on a 52 week basis ; and $ 13.9 million of sales due to the 53 rd week . on a 52 week basis , the increase in comparable restaurant sales resulted from an estimated effective menu price increase factor of approximately 3.0 % , coupled with an estimated 2.2 % benefit from increased guest traffic and an estimated 1.4 % benefit from a favorable menu mix shift and guest purchase incidence rates . our restaurants , like most in casual dining , are impacted by inflationary pressures for the costs of certain commodities , labor and other operating expenses . we attempt to offset the impact of inflation on our cost structure with purchasing economies of scale , productivity and efficiency improvements , menu merchandising and menu price increases . if our guests do not accept our menu price increases , either by reducing their visits to our restaurants or by changing their purchasing patterns at our restaurants , the expected benefit of any menu price increase could be negated and our operating margins could be adversely impacted .

"as such , our regulators determine the rates we are allowed to charge for our service based on our revenue requirements needed to achieve our authorized rates of return . we earn revenues from the delivery of natural gas , but do not earn a profit on the natural gas that we deliver , as those costs are passed through to our customers at cost . the primary components of our revenue requirements are the amount of capital invested in our business , which is also known as rate base , our allowed rate of return on our capital investments and our recoverable operating expenses , including depreciation and income taxes . our rates have both a fixed and a variable component , with approximately 74 percent of our natural gas sales net margin in 2016 derived from fixed monthly charges to our customers . the variable component of our rates is dependent on the consumption of natural gas , which is impacted primarily by the weather and , to a lesser extent , economic activity . while we have weather normalization mechanisms in most jurisdictions that adjust customers ' bills when the actual hdds differ from normalized hdds , these mechanisms are in place for only a portion of the year and do not offset all fluctuations in usage resulting from weather variability . accordingly , the weather can have either a positive or negative impact on our financial performance . our financial performance , therefore , is contingent on a number of factors , including : ( 1 ) regulatory outcomes , which determine the returns we are authorized to earn and the rates we are allowed to charge for our service ; ( 2 ) the consumption of natural gas , which impacts the amount of our net margin derived from the variable component of our rates ; ( 3 ) our operating performance , which impacts our operating expenses ; and ( 4 ) the perceived value of natural gas relative to other energy sources , particularly electricity , which influences our customers ' choice of natural gas to provide a portion of their energy needs . 27 we are subject to regulatory requirements for pipeline integrity and environmental compliance . these requirements impact our operating expenses and the level of capital expenditures required for compliance . historically , our regulators have allowed recovery of these expenditures . however , because integrity and environmental regulation is changing constantly , our capital and operating expenditures to comply will change , as well . although we believe our regulators will continue to allow recovery of such expenditures in the future , we will continue to make these expenditures with no assurance about if , or over what period , we will be permitted to recover them . recent developments in january 2017 , we declared a dividend of $ 0.42 per share ( $ 1.68 per share on an annualized basis ) for shareholders of record as of february 24 , 2017 , payable on march 10 , 2017. regulatory activities oklahoma - in march 2016 , oklahoma natural gas filed its energy efficiency program true-up application for its 2015 program year , requesting a utility incentive of $ 1.9 million and a program true-up adjustment of $ 3.1 million . this filing also sought approval for the demand portfolio of conservation and energy efficiency programs for calendar years 2017 through 2019. in october 2016 , the occ approved the joint stipulation and settlement agreement which was filed in august 2016. in july 2015 , oklahoma natural gas filed a request with the occ for an increase in base rates , reflecting system investments and operating costs necessary to maintain the safety and reliability of its natural gas distribution system . in january 2016 , the occ approved a joint stipulation and settlement agreement to allow an increase in revenue of $ 29,995,000. we also recorded a regulatory asset of $ 2.4 million to recover certain information technology costs incurred as a result of our separation from oneok in 2014 , which will be recovered over four years . the agreement set oklahoma natural gas ' authorized return on equity at 9.5 percent , which represents the midpoint of the allowed range of 9.0 to 10.0 percent , and approved a rate base of approximately $ 1.2 billion . the agreement includes the continuation , with certain modifications , of the pbrc tariff that was established in 2009. oklahoma natural gas expects to make its next pbrc filing on or before march 15 , 2017. in march 2015 , oklahoma natural gas filed its energy efficiency program true-up application for its 2014 program year , requesting a utility incentive of $ 1.2 million . in december 2015 , the occ approved the joint stipulation and settlement agreement which was filed in july 2015. oklahoma natural gas filed a pbrc application in march 2014. in june 2014 , a joint stipulation and settlement agreement associated with our pbrc filing was reached and contained an increase in base rates of approximately $ 13.7 million , and an energy-efficiency program true-up and a utility incentive adjustment of $ 0.9 million . in august 2014 , the settlement was approved by the occ . kansas - in may 2016 , kansas gas service filed a request with the kcc for an increase in base rates , reflecting system investments and operating costs necessary to maintain the safety and reliability of its natural gas distribution system . kansas gas service 's request represented a net base rate increase of $ 28.0 million . kansas gas service is already recovering approximately $ 7.4 million from customers through the gsrs mechanism , resulting in a total base rate increase of $ 35.4 million . the filing was based on a 10.0 percent return on equity and a common equity ratio of 55.0 percent . the filing represented a rate base of $ 903 million , compared with $ 826 million included in existing base rates plus previously approved gsrs-eligible investments . story_separator_special_tag should recovery cease due to regulatory actions , certain of these assets may no longer meet the criteria for recognition and accordingly , a writeoff of regulatory assets and stranded costs may be required . there were no writeoffs of regulatory assets resulting from the failure to meet the criteria for capitalization during 2016 , 2015 and 2014 . 29 we operate in one reportable business segment : regulated public utilities that deliver natural gas to residential , commercial , industrial , wholesale , public authority and transportation customers . we evaluate our financial performance principally on operating income . story_separator_special_tag depreciation and amortization expense increased $ 7.3 million due primarily to an increase in depreciation of $ 12.1 million from capital expenditures being placed in service , offset partially by a decrease in the amortization of the ad-valorem surcharge in kansas and the take-or-pay rider in oklahoma of $ 3.6 million . capital expenditures - our capital expenditures program includes expenditures for pipeline integrity , extending service to new areas , modifications to customer service lines , increasing system capabilities , pipeline replacements , automated meter reading , 31 government-mandated pipeline relocations , fleet , facilities and information technology assets . it is our practice to maintain and upgrade our infrastructure , facilities and systems to ensure safe , reliable and efficient operations . capital expenditures increased $ 14.7 million for 2016 , compared with 2015 , due primarily to increased system integrity activities and extending service to new areas . capital expenditures decreased $ 2.8 million for 2015 , compared with 2014 , due primarily to reduced spending on information technology hardware and software in 2014 related to our separation from oneok . our capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $ 350.0 million for 2017. selected operating information - the following tables set forth certain selected operating information for the periods indicated : replace_table_token_10_th replace_table_token_11_th replace_table_token_12_th total volumes delivered decreased for 2016 , compared with 2015 , due primarily to warmer temperatures in 2016. total volumes delivered decreased for 2015 , compared with 2014 , due primarily to warmer temperatures in 2015. the impacts on margins for the periods presented were mitigated largely by weather-normalization mechanisms . transportation volumes increased slightly for 2016 , compared with 2015 , due to a large industrial customer 's facility undergoing maintenance in 2015 , offset by a decrease in transportation volumes associated with smaller weather-sensitive customers . wholesale sales represent contracted natural gas volumes that exceed the needs of our residential , commercial and industrial customer base and are available for sale to other parties . the impact to net margin from changes in volumes associated with these customers is minimal . 32 replace_table_token_13_th replace_table_token_14_th normal hdds are established through rate proceedings in each of our rate jurisdictions for use primarily in weather normalization billing calculations . normal hdds disclosed above are based on : for 2016 , 10-year weighted average hdds as of december 31 , 2014 , for years 2005-2014 , as calculated using 11 weather stations across oklahoma and weighted on average customer count for oklahoma , and for 2015 and 2014 , 10-year weighted average hdds as of december 31 , 2008 , for years 1999-2008 , as calculated using 11 weather stations across oklahoma and weighted on average customer count for oklahoma ; 30-year average for years 1981-2010 published by the national oceanic and atmospheric administration , as calculated using 13 weather stations across kansas and weighted on hdds by weather station and customers for kansas ; and an average of hdds authorized in our most recent rate proceeding in each jurisdiction , and weighted using a rolling 10-year average of actual natural gas distribution sales volumes by jurisdiction for texas . actual hdds are based on year-to-date , weighted average of : 11 weather stations and customers by month for oklahoma ; 13 weather stations and customers by month for kansas ; and 9 weather stations and natural gas distribution sales volumes by service area for texas . contingencies we are a party to various litigation matters and claims that have arisen in the normal course of our operations . while the results of litigation and claims can not be predicted with certainty , we believe the reasonably possible losses from such matters , individually and in the aggregate , are not material . additionally , we believe the probable final outcome of such matters will not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations , financial position or cash flows . see note 13 of the notes to financial statements in this annual report for information with respect to legal proceedings . liquidity and capital resources general - we have relied primarily on operating cash flow and commercial paper for our liquidity and capital resource requirements . we fund operating expenses , working capital requirements , including purchases of natural gas , and capital expenditures primarily with cash from operations and commercial paper . we believe that the combination of the significant residential component of our customer base , the fixed-charge component of our natural gas sales net margin and our regulatory rate mechanisms that we have in place result in a stable cash flow profile . because the energy consumption of residential customers is less volatile compared with commercial and industrial customers , our business historically has generated stable and predictable net margin and cash flows . additionally , we have several 33 regulatory rate mechanisms in place to reduce the lag in earning a return on our capital expenditures . we anticipate that our cash flow generated from operations and our expected short- and long-term financing arrangements will enable us to maintain our current and planned level of operations and provide us flexibility to finance our infrastructure investments . our ability to access capital markets for debt and equity financing under reasonable terms depends on market conditions and our financial condition and credit ratings . we believe that stronger credit ratings will provide a significant advantage to our business .
","selected financial results - the following table sets forth certain selected financial results for our operations for the periods indicated : replace_table_token_7_th net margin is comprised of total revenues less cost of natural gas . cost of natural gas includes commodity purchases , fuel , storage , transportation and other gas purchase costs recovered through our cost of natural gas regulatory mechanisms and does not include an allocation of general operating costs or depreciation and amortization . in addition , our cost of natural gas regulatory mechanisms provide a method of recovering natural gas costs on an ongoing basis without a profit . therefore , although our revenues will fluctuate with the cost of gas that we purchase , net margin is not affected by fluctuations in the cost of natural gas . the following table sets forth our net margin , excluding other revenues , by type of customer , for the periods indicated : replace_table_token_8_th our net margin on natural gas sales is comprised of two components , fixed and variable margin . fixed margin reflects the portion of our net margin attributable to the monthly fixed customer charge component of our rates , which does not fluctuate based on customer usage in each period . variable margin reflects the portion of our net margin that fluctuates with the volumes delivered and billed . we believe that the combination of the significant residential component of our customer base , the fixed charge component of our sales margin and our regulatory rate mechanisms in place result in a stable cash flow profile .

accounting ” ( “ asu no . 2016-09 ” ) , as described further below . in presenting the consolidated financial statements , management makes estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported and related disclosures . management continually evaluates the accounting policies and estimates used to prepare the consolidated financial statements . the estimates , by their nature , are based on judgment , available information , and historical experience and are believed to be reasonable . however , actual amounts and results could differ from those estimates made by management . in management 's opinion , the consolidated financial statements contain all normal recurring adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of results reported . the results of operations reported for the periods presented are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations for subsequent periods . effective july 1 , 2018 , we adopted asu no . 2014-09 using the modified retrospective transition approach applied to all contracts . under this transition approach , we have not restated the prior period consolidated financial statements presented to the current period presentation . however , we have provided additional disclosures related to the amount by which each relevant fiscal 2019 financial statement line item was affected by the adoption of asu no . 2014-09 along with explanations for significant changes . additional information about the company 's revenue recognition policies and the related impact of the adoption of asu no . 2014-09 is included in note 2 , “ summary of significant accounting policies ” and note 3 , “ revenue recognition ” . effective july 1 , 2018 , we adopted asu no . 2016-01 , which requires changes in the fair value of publicly traded equity securities for which we do not have significant influence to be recorded as part of net earnings rather than as other comprehensive income ( loss ) , net . in addition , equity investments that do not have a readily determinable fair value will be recorded at cost less impairment as further adjusted for observable price changes in orderly transactions for identical or similar investments of the issuer . we adopted asu no . 2016-01 using the modified-retrospective transition approach by recording the cumulative effect of previously unrecognized gains or losses on publicly traded equity securities to retained earnings as of july 1 , 2018. the provisions of asu no . 2016-01 relative to equity investments that do not have a readily determinable fair value have been applied prospectively . the consolidated financial statements have not been revised for periods prior to july 1 , 2018. the impact of adopting asu no . 2016-01 resulted in a reclassification of less than $ 0.1 million in unrealized gains , net from accumulated other comprehensive loss to retained earnings as of july 1 , 2018. effective july 1 , 2018 , we adopted asu no . 2018-02 , which allows a reclassification from accumulated other comprehensive income to retained earnings for stranded tax effects associated with the change in the u.s. federal corporate tax rate resulting from the u.s. tax cuts and jobs act ( the “ tax act ” ) enacted in december 2017. the adoption of asu no . 2018-02 resulted in an increase to retained earnings of $ 1.5 million . effective july 1 , 2018 , we adopted asu no . 2017-07 , “ improving the presentation of net periodic pension cost and net periodic postretirement benefit cost ” ( “ asu no . 2017-07 ” ) whereby we revised its presentation in the consolidated statements of earnings to reflect the non-service cost components of net benefit cost as part of other non-operating income ( expenses ) , net , which were previously recorded as part of total operating expenses . all prior period information has been conformed to the current period presentation . 33 effective july 1 , 2017 , we adopted asu no . 2016-09 , which identifies areas for simplification involving several aspects of accounting for share-based payment transactions , including presenting the excess tax benefits ( “ etb ” ) or deficits from the exercise or vesting of share-based payments in the income statement , classifying the etb or deficits as an operating activity in the consolidated statements of cash flows rather than as a financing activity , a revision to the criteria for classifying an award as equity or liability and an option to recognize gross stock-based compensation expense with actual forfeitures recognized as they occur . in addition , asu no . 2016-09 eliminates the etb from the assumed proceeds calculation under the treasury stock method for purposes of calculating diluted shares . as a result of this adoption , we recorded etb related to stock-based compensation awards of $ 19.3 million an d $ 40.9 million during the twelve months ended june 30 , 2019 and 2018 in the income tax provision on a prospective basis , whereas such benefits would previously have been recognized in equity . we also excluded the etb from the assumed proceeds available to repurchase shares in the computation of diluted earnings per share for the twelve months ended june 30 , 2019 and 2018. we have not adjusted prior periods presented for the change in accounting for etb in the consolidated financial statements . we also elected to apply the change in presentation of etb in the consolidated statement of cash flows prospectively , and as a result , etb are classified as operating activities when realized through reductions to subsequent tax payments . this adoption resulted in an increase to net cash provided by operating activities and a corresponding decrease to net cash provided by financing activities of $ 19.3 million a nd $ 40.9 million for the twelve months ended june 30 , 2019 and 2018. we have not adjusted prior periods presented for the change in classification of etb on the consolidated statement of cash flows . we also elected to continue our current practice of estimating expected forfeitures as permitted by asu no .

off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition , changes in financial condition , revenues or expenses , results of operations , liquidity , capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors . 24 inflation inflation and changing prices have had no effect on our net sales and revenues or on our income from continuing operations over our two most recent fiscal years . critical accounting policies and estimates the financial statements of the company have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states . because a precise determination of many assets and liabilities is dependent upon future events , the preparation of financial statements for a period necessarily involves the use of estimates which have been made using careful judgment . the financial statements have , in management 's opinion , been properly prepared within reasonable limits of materiality and within the framework of the significant accounting policies summarized below . we have identified the following critical accounting policies that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and that require management 's most difficult , subjective or complex judgments , often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain . the following is a review of the more critical accounting policies and methods used by us : going concern the consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis which assumes the company will be able to realize its assets and discharge its liabilities in the normal course of business for the foreseeable future . the company has incurred net losses of $ 1,220,356 and $ 1,279,708 for the years ended december 31 , 2016 and 2015 , respectively , has incurred losses since inception resulting in an accumulated deficit of $ 19,739,419 as of december 31 , 2016 , and has negative working capital of $ 1,233,909 as of december 31 , 2016. a significant part of our negative working capital position at december 31 , 2016 consisted of $ 867,812 of amounts due to various accredited investors of the company for convertible promissory notes . the company anticipates further losses in the development of its business . the ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon the company generating profitable operations in the future and or obtaining the necessary financing to meet its obligations and repay its liabilities arising from normal business operations when they come due . the company 's ability to raise additional capital through the future issuances of debt or equity is unknown . the obtainment of additional financing , the successful development of the company 's contemplated plan of operations , or its attainment of profitable operations are necessary for the company to continue operations . the ability to successfully resolve these factors raise substantial doubt about the company 's ability to continue as a going concern . the consolidated financial statements of the company do not include any adjustments that may result from the outcome of these aforementioned uncertainties . revenue recognition revenues consist primarily of the sale of our gps tracking devices and the related monthly service fees , the sale of our gps smartsole , the monthly service fee from subscribers of the gps smartsole , and our mobile tracking applications sold via the apple itunes store and the google marketplace . the company recognizes revenue from product sales when the product is shipped to the customer and title has transferred . the company recognizes application revenue when the application is purchased by the customer . the company assumes no remaining significant obligations associated with the product sale other than that related to its warranty program discussed below . revenue related to monthly service fees both for the gps and ble smartsole , gps tracking devices , alert tag , licensing agreements and annual subscriptions are recognized over the respective terms of the agreements . revenue from multiple-element arrangements is allocated to the elements based on the relative fair value of each element , which is generally based on the relative sales price of each element when sold separately . each element 's allocated revenue is recognized when the revenue recognition criteria for that element have been met . if the company can not objectively determine the fair value of any undelivered element included in a multiple-element arrangement , the company defers revenue until all elements are delivered and services have been performed , or until

rental payments generated pursuant to an existing ground lease or rooftop lease ( and any subsequent lease or extension or amendment thereof ) between a property owner and an owner of a wireless tower or antennae ( each such lease , a “ tenant lease ” ) ( and any subsequent lease or extension or amendment thereof ) . typically , the apw group acquires the rental stream by way of a purchase of a real property interest in the land underlying the wireless tower or antennae , most commonly easements , usufructs , leasehold and sub-leasehold interests , or fee simple interests , each of which provides the apw group the right to receive the rents from the tenant lease . in addition , the apw group purchases contractual interests , such as an assignment of rents , either in 38 conjunction

operate in a complex environment with several factors affecting our operations in addition to those described above . the following discussion describes key factors and events that may affect our financial condition and results of operations . 40 impact of the covid-19 global pandemic the recent outbreak of covid-19 ( commonly referred to as coronavirus ) and the response thereto has had an impact in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate and has had a negative impact on economic conditions globally . at the end of the first quarter of 2020 , particularly during the last two weeks of march 2020 , many of the markets and countries in which we operate saw the imposition of stay at home orders and other lock down measures in response to covid-19 . accordingly , beginning in march 2020 , we took measures to mitigate the broader public health risks associated with covid-19 to our business and employees , including through office closures and self-isolation of employees ( including by holding virtual meetings ) where possible in line with the recommendations of relevant health authorities . while in the second quarter of 2020 we began to lift certain of these restrictions in line with such evolving recommendations , we continue to monitor developments related to the pandemic , and our decisions will continue to be driven by the health and well-being of our employees , business partners and communities . beginning in march 2020 , government-imposed restrictions on the opening of offices and or self-isolation measures have had an impact on our operations . in particular , our offices globally were largely shut down beginning in the middle of march 2020 , although in all cases our operations have continued with employees working remotely from their homes . in addition , as a result of the covid-19 outbreak , there have been and may continue to be short-term impacts on our ability to acquire new rental streams . for example , leasing transactions in certain civil law jurisdictions , such as brazil , chile and colombia , often require the notarization of legal documents in person as part of the closing procedure .

( ii ) the expected sales prices and sales incentives to be offered in a community ; ( iii ) costs expended to date and expected to be incurred in the future , including , but not limited to , land and land development costs , home construction , interest , and overhead costs ; ( iv ) alternative product offerings that may be offered in a community that will have an impact on sales pace , sales price , building cost , or the number of homes that can be built in a particular community ; and ( v ) alternative uses for the property , such as the possibility of a sale of the entire community to another builder or the sale of individual home sites . future communities : we evaluate all land held for future communities or future sections of operating communities , whether owned or optioned , to determine whether or not we expect to proceed with the development of the land as originally contemplated . this evaluation encompasses the same types of estimates used for operating communities described above , as well as an evaluation of the regulatory environment in which the land is located and the estimated probability of obtaining the necessary approvals , the estimated time and cost it will take to obtain those approvals , and the possible concessions that may be required to be given in order to obtain them . concessions may include cash payments to fund improvements to public places such as parks and streets , dedication of a portion of the property for use by the public or as open space , or a reduction in the density or size of the homes to be built . based upon this review , we decide ( i ) as to land under contract to be purchased , whether the contract will likely be terminated or renegotiated , and ( ii ) as to land we own , whether the land will likely be developed as contemplated or in an alternative manner , or should be sold . we then further determine whether costs that have been capitalized to the community are recoverable or should be written off . the write-off is charged to cost of revenues in the period in which the need for the write-off is determined . the estimates used in the determination of the estimated cash flows and fair value of both current and future communities are based on factors known to us at the time such estimates are made and our expectations of future operations and economic conditions . should the estimates or expectations used in determining estimated fair value deteriorate in the future , we may be required to recognize additional impairment charges and write-offs related to current and future communities and such amounts could be material . 27 we provided for inventory impairment charges and the expensing of costs that we believed not to be recoverable in each of the three fiscal years ended october 31 , 2018 , 2017 , and 2016 , as shown in the table below ( amounts in thousands ) : replace_table_token_12_th the table below provides , for the periods indicated , the number of operating communities that we reviewed for potential impairment , the number of operating communities in which we recognized impairment charges , the amount of impairment charges recognized , and , as of the end of the period indicated , the fair value of those communities , net of impairment charges ( $ amounts in thousands ) : replace_table_token_13_th income taxes — valuation allowance we assess the need for valuation allowances for deferred tax assets in each period based on whether it is more-likely-than-not that some portion of the deferred tax asset would not be realized . if , based on the available evidence , it is more-likely-than-not that such asset will not be realized , a valuation allowance is established against a deferred tax asset . the realization of a deferred tax asset ultimately depends on the existence of sufficient taxable income in either the carryback or carryforward periods under tax law . this assessment considers , among other matters , the nature , consistency , and magnitude of current and cumulative income and losses ; forecasts of future profitability ; the duration of statutory carryback or carryforward periods ; our experience with operating loss and tax credit carryforwards being used before expiration ; tax planning alternatives ; and outlooks for the u.s. housing industry and broader economy . changes in existing tax laws or rates could also affect our actual tax results . due to uncertainties in the estimation process , particularly with respect to changes in facts and circumstances in future reporting periods , actual results could differ from the estimates used in our assessment that could have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position . 28 as a result of the enactment of the tax act into law , we remeasured our net deferred tax liability for the tax law change , which resulted in an income tax benefit of $ 35.5 million in fiscal 2018. see note 8 , “ income taxes ” in notes to consolidated financial statements in item 15 ( a ) 1 of this form 10-k for additional information regarding the impact of the tax act . our deferred tax assets consist principally of timing of deductibility of accrued expenses , inventory impairments , inventory valuation differences , state tax net operating loss carryforwards , and stock-based compensation expense .

could differ materially from our historical results or those anticipated in our forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors , including those set forth under “ risk factors ” in item 1a and elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k. with respect to this section , the cautionary language applicable to such forward-looking statements described under “ forward-looking statements ” found before item 1 of this annual report on form 10-k is incorporated by reference into this item 7. about tidewater our vessels and associated vessel services provide support for all phases of offshore oil and natural gas exploration , field development and production as well as windfarm development and maintenance . these services include towing of , and anchor handling for , mobile offshore drilling units ; transporting supplies and personnel necessary to sustain drilling , workover and production activities ; offshore construction and seismic and subsea support ; geotechnical survey support for windfarm construction ; and a variety of specialized services such as pipe and cable laying . in addition , we have one of the broadest geographic operating footprints in the offshore vessel industry . our global operating footprint allows us to react quickly to changing local market conditions and to be responsive to the changing requirements of the many customers with which we believe we have strong relationships . we are also one of the most experienced international operators in the offshore energy industry with a history spanning over 60 years . on november 15 , 2018 ( merger date ) , we completed our merger with gulfmark offshore , inc. gulfmark pursuant to the agreement and plan of the merger dated july 15 , 2018. gulfmark 's balances and results are included in our consolidated financial statements and disclosures beginning on the merger date . therefore , our balances and results for the years ended december 31 , 2020 and 2019 include gulfmark 's operations while our balances and results for the year ended december 30 , 2018 only include gulfmark 's operations for the last 45 days . at december 31 , 2020 , we owned 172 vessels with an average age of 10.4 years ( excluding 3 joint venture vessels , but including 35 stacked active vessels and 23 vessels designated for sale ) available to serve the global energy industry . the average age of our 149 active vessels at december 31 , 2020 is 10.2 years . principal factors that drive our results our revenues , net earnings and cash flows from operations are largely dependent upon the activity level of our offshore marine vessel fleet . as is the case with the numerous other vessel operators in our industry , our business activity is largely dependent on the level of exploration , field development and production activity of our customers . our customers ' business activity , in turn , is dependent on current and expected crude oil and natural gas prices , which fluctuate depending on expected future levels of supply and demand for crude oil and natural gas , and on estimates of the cost to find , develop and produce crude oil and natural gas reserves . our revenues in all segments are driven primarily by our fleet size , vessel utilization and day rates . because a sizeable portion of our operating and depreciation costs do not change proportionally with changes in revenue , our operating profit is largely dependent on revenue levels . operating costs consist primarily of crew costs , repair and maintenance costs , insurance costs , fuel , lube oil and supplies costs and other vessel operating costs . fleet size , fleet composition , geographic areas of operation , supply and demand for marine personnel , and local labor requirements are the major factors which affect overall crew costs in all segments . in addition , our newer , more technologically sophisticated vessels generally require a greater number of specially trained , more highly compensated fleet personnel than our older , smaller and less sophisticated vessels . crew costs may increase if competition for skilled personnel intensifies , although a weaker offshore energy market could mitigate any potential inflation of crew costs . 32 costs related to the recertification of vessels are deferred and amortized over 30 months on a straight-line basis . maintenance costs incurred at the time of the recertification drydocking that are not related to the recertification of the vessel are expensed as incurred . costs related to vessel improvements that either extend the vessel 's useful life or increase the vessel 's functionality are capitalized and depreciated . insurance costs are dependent on a variety of factors , including our safety record and pricing in the insurance markets , and can fluctuate over time . our vessels are generally insured for up to their estimated fair market value in order to cover damage or loss resulting from marine casualties , adverse weather conditions , mechanical failure , collisions , and property losses to the vessel . we also purchase coverage for potential liabilities stemming from third-party losses with limits that we believe are reasonable for our operations , but do not generally purchase business interruption insurance or similar coverage . insurance limits are reviewed annually , and third-party coverage is purchased based on the expected scope of ongoing operations and the cost of third-party coverage . story_separator_special_tag prices began to stabilize in the $ 50.00 to $ 60.00 per barrel range in 2019 and early 2020. however , in the first quarter of 2020 the industry was severely impacted by the previously discussed global pandemic ( covid-19 ) and the resulting loss of demand and decrease in oil prices . as covid-19 spread throughout the world , its impact on many of our locations , including our vessels , has affected our operations . we have implemented various protocols for both onshore and offshore personnel in efforts to limit this impact , but there is no assurance that those efforts will be fully successful . any spread of covid-19 to our onshore workforce or key management personnel could prevent us from supporting our offshore operations , reduce productivity as our onshore personnel continue to work remotely , and disrupt our business . any outbreak on our vessels may result in the vessel , or some or all of a vessel crew , being quarantined and therefore impede the vessel 's ability to generate revenue . we have experienced challenges in connection with our offshore crew changes due to health and travel restrictions related to covid-19 , and those challenges and or restrictions are expected to continue despite our efforts at mitigating them . to the extent the covid-19 pandemic adversely affects our operations and business , it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks set forth in our sec filings . the effect on our business includes lockdowns of shipyards where we have vessels performing drydocks which will delay vessels returning to service and the cancellation and or temporary delay of certain revenue vessel contracts allowed either under the contract provisions or by mutual agreement with our customers . these cancellations and or temporary delays reduced our 2020 revenues by approximately 18.0 % . we also incurred approximately $ 18.0 million in higher operating costs , primarily related to additional crew costs , mobilization and vessel stacking costs as a result of these unplanned contract cancellations . there may be additional cancellations or delays . as a company , we have undertaken the following temporary measures to assist us in weathering the covid-19 pandemic and allow us to recover as soon as possible : planned capital and drydock expenditures tied to contracts referenced above will be temporarily delayed or cancelled . as a result of the ongoing contract cancellations and delays we postponed drydocks expected to cost approximately $ 23.3 million in 2020. budgeted drydocks expenditures for 2021 are expected to be approximately $ 19.0 million . it is possible that additional planned drydocks will be cancelled or delayed due to contract cancellations or delays . we can not predict the number or cost of any additional cancellations or delays . we have the ability to rapidly respond to contract cancellations and delays . we have or will remove the crews and shut down all operations , depending on contract terms , on vessels associated with cancelled or delayed contracts . we continue to evaluate our general and administrative costs to reflect the current demand for our offshore support vessels . the full impact of the covid-19 pandemic on our business and operations will depend on the severity , location , and duration of the effects and spread of the pandemic itself , the actions undertaken by national , regional , and local governments and health officials to contain the virus or treat its effects , and how quickly and to what extent economic conditions improve and normal business and operating conditions resume . as we can not predict the duration or scope of this pandemic , the anticipated negative financial impact to our operating results can not be reasonably estimated but could be both material and long-lasting . in the first and second quarters of 2020 , we considered these events surrounding the covid-19 pandemic and the resulting oil price decrease and demand reduction to be indicators that the value of our active offshore vessel fleet may be impaired . as a result , as of march 31 , 2020 and june 30 , 2020 , we performed step 1 evaluations of our active offshore fleet under fasb accounting standards codification 360 , which governs the methodology for identifying and recording impairment of long-lived assets to determine if any of our asset groups have net book value in excess of undiscounted future net cash flows . our evaluations did not indicate impairment of any of our asset groups . during the third quarter conditions related to the pandemic and oil price environment did not worsen from the second quarter and in the fourth quarter industry conditions marginally improved compared with the third quarter . as a result , we did not identify additional events or conditions that would require us to perform a step 1 evaluation during either quarter . we will continue to monitor the expected future cash flows and the fair market value of our asset groups for impairment . story_separator_special_tag center ; width : 100 % '' > 37 in addition , our income tax benefit was $ 1.0 million in the year ended december 31 , 2020 compared with an income tax expense of $ 27.7 million in the year ended december 31 , 2019 primarily due to the reversal of some uncertain tax positions during 2020 as well as an nol carryback for a tax refund under the coronavirus aid , relief , and economic security ( cares ) act . americas segment operations . vessel revenues in the americas segment decreased 7.5 % , or $ 10.3 million , during the year ended december 31 , 2020 , as compared to the year ended december 31 , 2019. the decrease is primarily due to a decrease of five active vessels primarily due to the pandemic .

are to generate high risk-adjusted returns by : ( i ) investing across a diverse set of asset classes , geographies , factors , themes and time horizons , ( ii ) identifying and exploiting temporarily pronounced market inefficiencies or risk premia , ( iii ) employing dynamic risk-budgeting to minimize tail risk and potentially enable alpha to be generated through timing of exposures and ( iv ) utilizing sophisticated modeling techniques supported by straight-forward economic intuition and sound fundamentals . secor will seek to target long-term annualized volatility of 15 % and low long-term correlation to other hedge fund strategies and broader markets . secor has a healthy respect for the general information efficiency of markets but believes that certain inefficiencies ( or outsized risk premia ) may exist in certain markets , and these or other inefficiencies ( or risk premia ) may periodically become more pronounced in particular market conditions . secor believes that it is feasible to construct an investment strategy that seeks to capture such inefficiencies ( premia ) in pursuit of high risk-adjusted returns ( or excess returns for benchmarked mandates ) that are lowly correlated with broad stock and bond market returns ( alpha ) . secor employs statistical techniques and empirical analysis to help determine whether they believe that observed or conjectured alpha opportunities are real and , more importantly , likely to be sustained in the future . if properly employed , these techniques may have certain advantages versus a purely judgmental approach including the potential ability to : control for the impact of particular factors , evaluate phenomena over a longer history , systematically assess confidence levels based on availability of data , evaluate performance over certain sub-periods and market cycles , identify certain possible causation and lead/lag effects , reduce certain common behavioral biases in human judgment and evaluate a

provides regional dry van truckload services through its regional terminals and its corporate headquarters . the company transports freight for major shippers and generally earns revenue based on the number of miles per load delivered . the company 's eleven regional operating divisions , not including operations at the corporate headquarters , accounted for 74.3 % , 72.8 % , and 71.3 % of the operating revenues for the year ended december 31 , 2012 , 2011 and 2010 , respectively . on-time customer service continues to be a key operating goal of the company . the company believes the keys to maintaining a high level of service are the availability of late-model equipment and experienced drivers . operating efficiencies and cost controls are achieved through equipment utilization , operating a fleet of late model equipment , maintaining an industry leading driver to non-driver employee ratio , and the effective management of fixed and variable operating costs . during 2009 industry capacity ( available trucks ) significantly exceeded demands for freight services largely due to a significant decline in the u.s. economy and consumer spending . as such , there was significant downward pressure on freight rates throughout 2009 and into 2010. general economic conditions and downward pressure on freight rates caused increases in trucking company bankruptcies and other company tractor fleet reductions during this same period . as a result of trucking company failures and other company fleet reductions , during 2010 , industry capacity came back in line with demand for freight services after a period of industry capacity significantly exceeding demand for freight services . during the periods of 2011 and 2012 there has been close balance of industry capacity and demand for freight services although the demand for freight services has not reached levels of demand that existed during the years immediately preceding 2009. balancing of the industry capacity and demand of freight services has allowed the company to obtain freight rate increases although these increases have not covered the company 's increases in operating costs . competition for drivers , which is always intense , escalated during 2011 due to general improvements in the demand for freight services . the company has experienced increasing difficulties attracting and retaining qualified drivers . the company continues to explore new ideas and ways to attract and retain qualified drivers . 18 containment of fuel cost continues to be one of management 's top priorities . the company continues to be challenged by increased fuel prices and anticipates that fuel prices will remain at or above current levels . average diesel fuel prices have increased each year over the past year during the periods 2009 through 2012. average department of energy ( `` doe '' ) diesel prices for 2009 through 2012 have been , $ 2.47 , $ 3.00 , $ 3.85 , and $ 3.97 , respectively . most recently the doe price was $ 4.16 . the company continues to manage and implement fuel initiative strategies to effectively manage fuel costs . these initiatives include strategic fueling of our trucks whether it be terminal fuel or over-the-road fuel , reduction of tractor idle time , controlling out-of-route miles , controlling empty miles , trailer skirting , and increased fuel economy through the purchase of newer , more fuel efficient tractors . the company is not able to pass through all fuel price increases through fuel surcharge agreements with customers due to tractor idling time , along with empty and out-of-route miles . the company continues to focus on fuel surcharge pricing , truck idling hours , and fuel purchasing decisions in an effort to lessen the impact of higher fuel costs . at december 31 , 2012 , 100 % of the company 's tractor fleet is equipped with idle management controls . at december 31 , 2012 , the company 's tractor fleet had an average age of 2.4 years and the company 's trailer fleet had an average age of 3.1 years . the average age of tractor equipment is expected to improve throughout 2013 as the company takes delivery of new tractors and the trailer fleet is expected to remain consistent throughout 2013 with the sale of older units . the company continues to focus on growing internally by providing quality service to targeted customers with a high density of freight in the company 's regional operating areas . story_separator_special_tag year ended december 31 , 2011 compared with the year ended december 31 , 2010 operating revenue increased $ 29.1 million ( 5.8 % ) , to $ 528.6 million for the year ended december 31 , 2011 from $ 499.5 million for the year ended december 31 , 2010. the increase in revenue was mainly the result of a $ 32.5 million ( 43.2 % ) increase in fuel surcharge revenue from $ 75.3 million in 2010 to $ 107.8 million in 2011. line haul and other revenues decreased $ 3.4 million ( 0.8 % ) on a decrease in total miles , offset by an increase in freight rates per total mile . fuel surcharge revenues represent fuel costs passed on to customers based on customer specific fuel charge recovery rates and billed loaded miles . fuel surcharge revenues 21 increased mostly as a result of a 28.4 % increase in average doe diesel fuel prices during the year ended december 31 , 2011 compared to the same period of 2010 , as well as an improvement in loaded miles versus total miles comparing the two periods . salaries , wages , and benefits decreased $ 1.3 million ( 0.8 % ) , to $ 166.7 million for the year ended december 31 , 2011 from $ 168.0 million in the 2010 period . the decrease was the net result of a $ 3.0 million decrease ( 2.5 % ) in driver wages , a $ 0.4 million increase ( 2.1 % ) in office and shop wages , a $ 1.9 million ( 37.4 % ) increase in workers ' compensation and a $ 1.0 million decrease in health insurance ( 11.0 % ) , and a $ 0.4 million increase in other benefits and payroll taxes . the company driver wage decrease was mainly due a decrease in miles driven year over year as well as a decrease in the overall company average wage rate per mile due mainly to the mix of company drivers based on operating region locations . office and shop personnel wages increased primarily as a result of more non-driver personnel in 2011 compared to the same period of 2010. health insurance and workers ' compensation decreased and increased , respectively , due to frequency and severity of claims . rent and purchased transportation decreased $ 1.9 million ( 20.4 % ) , to $ 7.5 million for the year ended december 31 , 2011 from $ 9.5 million in the comparable period of 2010. the decrease is mainly attributable to a decrease in amounts paid to independent contractors due to fewer miles driven as a result of fewer independent contractors driving for the company . during the year ended december 31 , 2011 , independent contractors accounted for 2 % of the total fleet miles compared to approximately 3 % for the same period in 2010. fuel increased $ 35.4 million ( 28.0 % ) , to $ 161.9 million for the year ended december 31 , 2011 from $ 126.5 million for the same period of 2010. the increase is primarily the result of increased fuel prices , $ 37.6 million , which was offset by a decrease in volume of $ 2.2 million mainly due to fewer miles driven . fuel cost per mile , net of fuel surcharge , increased 7.1 % in the 2011 period compared to the same period of 2010. the doe average diesel price per gallon for the year ended december 31 , 2011 was $ 3.85 per gallon compared to the same period of 2010 of $ 3.00 per gallon a 28.4 % increase . the difference in the increase in the doe average price and the company 's fuel cost per mile , net of fuel surcharge is largely attributable to newer , more fuel efficient , revenue equipment and improvements in the company 's total average fuel economy as well as increases in fuel surcharge revenues . depreciation decreased $ 4.7 million ( 7.6 % ) , to $ 57.2 million during the year ended december 31 , 2011 from $ 61.9 million in the same period of 2010. the decrease is mainly attributable to a decrease in average depreciation per tractor due to timing of tractor purchases and the company 's tractor depreciation method . as tractors are depreciated using the declining balance method , depreciation expense declines in years subsequent to the first year after initial purchase . the majority of the company 's current tractor fleet were purchased throughout 2009. therefore each year after the initial purchase , depreciation expense is lower on a per unit basis . tractors purchased subsequent to january 1 , 2009 are being depreciated using the 150 % declining balance method and accounted for approximately 89.3 % of the total tractor fleet at december 31 , 2010 which was increased to 100.0 % during the 4th quarter of 2011. tractors purchased prior to january 1 , 2009 are depreciated using the 125 % declining balance method . the change was the result of the cost of new tractors , current tractor trade values and the expected values in the used equipment market . the decrease in tractor depreciation due to the aging of equipment was partially offset by higher depreciation on new tractors placed in service during 2011. tractor depreciation decreased $ 7.4 million to $ 44.1 million for the year ended december 31 , 2011 from $ 51.5 million in the same period 2010 as a result of the above items . there was an increase of $ 2.8 million in trailer depreciation in the year ended december 31 , 2011 compared to 2010. the increase in trailer depreciation was the direct result of trailers that had previously been depreciated to salvage value in a prior period being replaced by new trailers . the change in all other depreciation was not significant .

"most of our leases are `` net leases '' under which the tenant , directly or indirectly , is responsible for paying the real estate taxes , insurance and ordinary maintenance and repairs of the property . as of december 31 , 2018 , we own 119 properties and our joint ventures own four properties . these 123 properties are located in 30 states . we face a variety of risks and challenges in our business . as more fully described under `` item 1a . risk factors `` , we , among other things , face the possibility we will not be able to acquire accretive properties on acceptable terms , lease our properties on terms favorable to us or at all , our tenants may not be able to pay their rental and other obligations and we may not be able to renew or re-let , on acceptable terms , leases that are expiring or otherwise terminating . we seek to manage the risk of our real property portfolio and the related financing arrangements by diversifying among types of properties , industries , locations , tenants , scheduled lease expirations , 31 mortgage maturities and lenders , and by seeking to minimize our exposure to interest rate fluctuations . as a result , as of december 31 , 2018 : our 2019 contractual rental income is derived from the following property types : 46.1 % from industrial , 36.6 % from retail , 4.9 % from restaurant , 4.5 % from health and fitness , 3.2 % from theater and 4.7 % from other properties , there are no states with properties that account for more than 8.7 % of 2019 contractual rental income , no tenant accounts for more than 7.0 % of 2019 contractual rental income , through 2027 , there are only two years in which the percentage of our contractual rental income represented by expiring leases exceeds 10 % of our 2019 contractual rental income ( i.e . , 20.4 % in 2022 and 11.5 % in 2023 ) approximately 31.7 % of our 2019 contractual rental income is represented by leases expiring in 2028 and thereafter , after giving effect to interest rate swap agreements , substantially all of our mortgage debt bears interest at fixed rates , until 2022 , not more than 6 % of our total scheduled principal mortgage payments is due in any year , and there are seven different counterparties to our portfolio of interest rate swaps : three counterparties , rated a- or better by a national rating agency , account for 69.9 % , or $ 82.0 million , of the notional value of our swaps ; and two counterparties , rated bb or better by a national rating agency , account for 23.0 % , or $ 26.9 million , of the notional value of such swaps . we monitor the risk of tenant non-payments through a variety of approaches tailored to the applicable situation . generally , based on our assessment of the credit risk posed by our tenants , we monitor a tenant 's financial condition through one or more of the following actions : reviewing tenant financial statements or other financial information , obtaining other tenant related information , regular contact with tenant 's representatives , tenant credit checks and regular management reviews of our tenants . we may sell a property if the tenant 's financial condition is unsatisfactory . in acquiring properties , we balance an evaluation of the terms of the leases and the credit of the existing tenants with a fundamental analysis of the real estate to be acquired , which analysis takes into account , among other things , the estimated value of the property , local demographics and the ability to re-rent or dispose of the property on favorable terms upon lease expiration or early termination . we are sensitive to the risks facing the retail industry as a result of the growth of e-commerce . we are addressing our exposure to the retail industry by seeking to acquire industrial properties that we believe capitalize on e-commerce activities , such as e-commerce distribution and warehousing facilities , and by being especially selective in acquiring retail properties . as a result , retail properties generated 41.9 % , 43.3 % , and 46.1 % of rental income , net , in 2018 , 2017 , and 2016 , respectively , and industrial properties generated 39.1 % , 34.1 % , and 30.8 % of rental income , net , in 2018 , 2017 , and 2016 , respectively . story_separator_special_tag style= '' font-family : times ; '' > we may be adversely affected if , among other

statements of expected future developments , as defined in the private securities litigation reform act of 1995. this discussion contains forward-looking statements about our business , operations and industry that involve risks and uncertainties , such as statements regarding our plans , objectives , expectations and intentions . our future results and financial condition may differ materially from those we currently anticipate as a result of the factors we describe under “ cautionary statement concerning forward-looking statements ” and “ risk factors. ” currently , such risks and uncertainties also include , among others : suncoke 's ability to manage its business during and after the covid-19 pandemic ; the impact of the covid-19 pandemic on suncoke 's results of operations ,

; and the general impact on our industry and on the u.s. and global economy resulting from covid-19 , including actions by domestic and foreign governments and others to contain the spread , or mitigate the severity , thereof . this management 's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ( `` md & a '' ) is based on financial data derived from the financial statements prepared in accordance with united states ( “ u.s. ” ) generally accepted accounting principles ( “ gaap ” ) and certain other financial data that is prepared using a non-gaap measure . for

md & a is provided in addition to the accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes to assist readers in understanding our results of operations , financial condition and cash flows . our results of operations include reference to our business operations and market conditions , which are further described in part i of this document . 2020 overview our consolidated results of operations in 2020 were as follows : year ended december 31 , 2020 ( dollars in millions ) net income $ 8.8 net cash provided by operating activities $ 157.8 adjusted ebitda $ 205.9 with the new challenges of the covid-19 pandemic , the company revised our key objectives in 2020 and delivered against those objectives , including : successfully navigated through the ongoing covid-19 pandemic . on march 11 , 2020 , the world health organization declared the outbreak of covid-19 a pandemic . our facilities continued to operate during the covid-19 pandemic due to our inclusion in the critical manufacturing sector as defined by the u.s. department of homeland security and the designation as an essential business by state and local government authorities . our top priority has been and continues to be the safety and health of our employees and contractors . in response to the outbreak , we established an internal task force of subject matter experts , initiated enhanced health and safety measures across our facilities and enacted a work from home program for all qualifying personnel . we have implemented screening procedures consistent with u.s. centers for disease control and prevention ( “ cdc ” ) recommendations , which may include screening questionnaires and temperature checks for employees , contractors , or other service providers . additionally , to ensure employee safety , we have also adopted protocols consistent with cdc , state , and local guidance , which include but are not limited to increased cleaning and disinfection , social distancing , physical separations , mask requirements , contact tracing and quarantine . we continue to closely monitor the impact of the outbreak of covid-19 on all aspects of our business , including how it has and will impact our suppliers . we have not experienced any significant impacts or interruptions with respect to our ability to procure coal as a result of covid-19 , and we will continue to closely monitor our inventory levels to mitigate the risk of any potential supply interruptions . 32 achieved revised financial objectives . as a result of the reduction in coke volumes during 2020 further discussed below , in august 2020 , we revised our 2020 guidance range for adjusted ebitda from $ 235 million to $ 245 million to $ 190 million to $ 200 million as well as our guidance for cash generated from operating activities from approximately $ 170 million to $ 180 million to approximately $ 116 million to $ 136 million . we delivered adjusted ebitda of $ 205.9 million , and generated $ 157.8 million of operating cash flow , both of which exceeded our revised guidance , and net income of $ 8.8 million . strong performance from our domestic coke operations , coupled with excellent company-wide cost management drove the financial performance in excess of the revised guidance . see note 20 in our consolidated financial statements for both the definition of adjusted ebitda and the reconciliation from gaap to the non-gaap measurement . supported customer base and executed successful relief negotiations . steelmaking customers faced a challenging environment in 2020. in response to the decline in end user demand as well as in an effort to slow the spread of covid-19 , end user manufacturers began idling plants , which directly and adversely impacted our customers .

with and into suncoke energy partners finance corp. , which is also a wholly-owned subsidiary of the company . the simplification transaction was accounted for as a non-cash equity transaction , and no gain or loss was recognized in our consolidated statements of operations for this transaction . the company incurred transaction costs totaling $ 11.0 million , of which $ 5.4 million were incurred by suncoke and were capitalized as a reduction to additional paid-in capital on the consolidated balance sheets . the remaining transaction costs were incurred by the partnership resulting in $ 4.9

respectively . subsequent to the closing of the simplification transaction , suncoke incurred $ 0.3 million of legal and consulting costs , which were included in selling , general and administrative expenses on the consolidated statements of operations . all transaction costs were excluded from adjusted ebitda . with the closing of the simplification transaction , the income previously attributable to noncontrolling interest in the partnership became 100 percent attributable to suncoke and , therefore , and is now taxable to the company . adverse logistics customer developments . a significant portion of our logistics business has historically been from long-term , take-or-pay contracts with murray american coal , inc. ( `` murray '' ) and foresight energy llc ( `` foresight '' ) , which were adversely impacted by declining coal export prices and domestic demand . murray filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy on october 29 , 2019. foresight engaged outside counsel and financial advisors to assess restructuring options during 2019 and subsequently filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy on march 10 , 2020. both murray and foresight 's contracts with cmt were subsequently rejected by the bankruptcy courts . as a result of these developments , during 2019 , the company recorded non-cash , pre-tax impairment charges to the logistics segment on the consolidated statements of operations of $ 247.4 million , of which $ 73.5 million represented a full write-down of the logistics goodwill balance , as well as a $ 113.3 million impairment of cmt 's long-lived intangible assets and a $ 60.6 million impairment of cmt 's properties , plants and equipment . 34 see note 8 to our consolidated financial statements . these non-cash impairment charges resulted in a $ 69.1 million income tax benefit in 2019. consolidated results of operations the following section includes year-over-year analysis of consolidated results of operations for the year ended december 31 , 2020 as compared to the year ended december 31 , 2019. see `` analysis of segment results '' later in this section for further details of these results . refer to management 's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in our 2019 annual report on form 10-k for the year-over-year analysis of consolidated results of operations for the year ended december 31 , 2019 as compared to the year ended december 31 , 2018. replace_table_token_5_th ( 1 ) see year-over-year changes described in `` items impacting comparability . '' sales and other operating revenue and costs of products sold and operating expenses . sales and other operating revenue and costs of products sold and operating expenses decreased in 2020 as compared to 2019 , primarily due to the pass-through of lower coal prices as well as the impact of volume relief provided to our customers impacted by the covid-19 pandemic in our domestic coke segment . revenues further declined as a result of lower volumes in our logistics segment . selling , general and administrative expenses . the increase in selling , general and administrative expense was driven by research and development costs related to foundry coke production of $ 3.9 million , higher expense of $ 2.0 million as a result of revaluing certain legacy liabilities as well as costs incurred to resolve certain legal matters . these increases were partly offset by lower employee related expenses during 2020 as compared to 2019 as well as the absence of $ 4.9 million of transaction costs incurred during 2019 . depreciation and amortization expense . the decrease in depreciation and amortization expense during 2020 was partly driven by the impairment of our logistics assets during 2019 , which lowered the carrying value of those assets and decreased the related depreciation expense , as well as the absence of accelerated depreciation associated with upgrades to certain heat recovery steam generators , which was recorded in 2019. these decreases were partially offset by depreciation in 2020 on assets newly placed in service , primarily related to the completion of rebuilt ovens at indiana harbor near the end of 2019 , which increased depreciation $ 8.1 million in 2020 as compared to 2019. interest expense , net . weighted average debt balances during 2020 and 2019 were $ 785.8 million and $ 845.0 million , respectively . weighted average interest rates during 2020 and 2019 were 6.74 percent and 7.16 percent , respectively , resulting in related interest expense of $ 52.9 million and $ 60.5 million , respectively . a reduction in libor-based interest rates and lower interest rates on our revolving facility as a result of the restructuring in the third quarter of 2019 , as well as 35 lower balances on our higher interest rate debt due to the repurchases of our senior notes in 2020 resulted in lower weighted average interest rates in 2020 as compared to 2019. income taxes .
","results of reportable business segments we report our business results through three segments : domestic coke consists of our jewell facility , located in vansant , virginia , our indiana harbor facility , located in east chicago , indiana , our haverhill facility , located in franklin furnace , ohio , our granite city facility located in granite city , illinois , and our middletown facility located in middletown , ohio . brazil coke consists of operations in vitória , brazil , where we operate the arcelormittal brazil cokemaking facility . logistics consists of convent marine terminal ( `` cmt '' ) , located in convent , louisiana , kanawha river terminal ( `` krt '' ) , located in ceredo and belle , west virginia , suncoke lake terminal ( `` lake terminal '' ) , located in east chicago , indiana , and dismal river terminal ( `` drt '' ) , located in vansant , virginia . lake terminal and drt are located adjacent to our indiana harbor and jewell cokemaking facilities , respectively . the operations of each of our segments are described in part i of this document . corporate expenses that can be identified with a segment have been included in determining segment results . the remainder is included in corporate and other , including activity from our legacy coal mining business . management believes adjusted ebitda is an important measure of operating performance and uses it as the primary basis for the chief operating decision maker to evaluate the performance of each of our reportable segments . adjusted ebitda should not be considered a substitute for the reported results prepared in accordance with gaap . see note 20 to our consolidated financial statements .

"ipl and wpl are public utilities , and aef is the parent company for alliant energy 's non-utility businesses and holds all of alliant energy 's atc investment . corporate services provides administrative services to alliant energy and its subsidiaries . an illustration of alliant energy 's primary businesses is shown below . alliant energy utilities and corporate services atc investment , non-utility and parent - retail electric and gas services in ia ( ipl ) - atc investment ( ati ) - retail electric and gas services in wi ( wpl ) - transportation ( aef ) - wholesale electric service in mn , il & ia ( ipl ) - non-utility wind investment ( aef ) - wholesale electric service in wi ( wpl ) - sheboygan falls energy facility ( aef ) - corporate services - parent company utilities and corporate services - ipl and wpl own a portfolio of egus located in iowa , wisconsin and minnesota with a diversified fuel mix including natural gas , renewable resources and coal . the output from these egus , supplemented with purchased power , is used to provide electric service to approximately 960,000 electric customers in the upper midwest . the utility business also procures natural gas from various suppliers to provide service to approximately 410,000 retail gas customers in the upper midwest . alliant energy 's utility business is its primary source of earnings and cash flows . the earnings and cash flows from the utilities and corporate services business are sensitive to various external factors including , but not limited to , the amount and timing of rates approved by regulatory authorities , the impact of weather and economic conditions on electric and gas sales volumes and other factors listed in “ risk factors ” in item 1a and “ forward-looking statements . ” atc investment , non-utility business and parent - aef holds all of alliant energy 's atc investment . aef also manages various businesses including transportation ( short-line railway and barge transportation services ) , a non-utility wind investment , the sheboygan falls energy facility and several other modest investments . financial results - alliant energy 's net income and eps attributable to alliant energy common shareowners were as follows ( dollars in millions , except per share amounts ) : replace_table_token_36_th the table above includes eps from continuing operations for utilities and corporate services , atc investment , and non-utility and parent , which are non-gaap financial measures . alliant energy believes these non-gaap financial measures are useful to investors because they facilitate an understanding of segment performance and trends , and provide additional information about alliant energy 's operations on a basis consistent with the measures that management uses to manage its operations and evaluate its performance . replace_table_token_37_th alliant energy 's , ipl 's and wpl 's income from continuing operations increased ( decreased ) by $ 82 million , $ 1 million and ( $ 4 ) million , respectively , in 2017 compared to 2016 . alliant energy 's increase was primarily due to asset valuation charges at aef related to the franklin county wind farm in 2016 , higher margins resulting from ipl 's interim retail electric base rate increase implemented in april 2017 and wpl 's retail electric and gas base rate increases implemented in january 2017 , and the effects of tax reform , partially offset by higher depreciation expense , higher energy efficiency cost recovery amortization at wpl , and the estimated temperature impacts on ipl 's and wpl 's retail electric and gas sales . wpl 's decrease was also impacted by reduced equity income resulting from the transfer of wpl 's investment in atc to ati on december 31 , 2016. refer to “ results of operations ” for additional details regarding the various factors impacting earnings during 2017 , 2016 and 2015 . 2017 overview - in 2017 , alliant energy , ipl and wpl focused on achieving financial objectives and executing their strategic plan . key developments in 2017 include the following : tax reform - in december 2017 , tax reform was enacted . the enactment of tax reform had a material impact on the 2017 financial statements since changes in tax laws must be recognized in the period in which the law is enacted . the most significant provision of tax reform was the reduction in the federal corporate tax rate from 35 % to 21 % , which required a re-measurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities in december 2017. the net impacts of re-measuring deferred taxes associated with regulated utility operations were recorded in regulatory assets and regulatory liabilities and will be utilized to provide benefits to customers in the future . refer to note 11 for further discussion of the impacts of tax reform . ipl 's marshalltown generating station - marshalltown , a 706 mw natural gas-fired combined-cycle egu , was placed into service in april 2017. final capital expenditures were $ 645 million to construct the egu and a pipeline to supply natural gas to the egu , excluding transmission network upgrades and afudc . franklin county wind farm - in april 2017 , the 99 mw franklin county wind farm was transferred from aef to ipl . ipl 's and wpl 's potential expansion of wind generation - ipl and wpl currently plan on expanding their wind generation by up to 1,000 mw and 200 mw , respectively , by the end of 2020. in 2016 , ipl received approval from the iub for the first 500 mw of wind generation . in august 2017 , ipl filed an application with the iub for advance rate-making principles for a second 500 mw of wind generation , and is currently expecting a decision from the iub in the first quarter of 2018. in november 2017 , wpl filed for approval from the pscw and ferc to acquire 55 mw of fwec , which is a 129 mw wind farm located in wisconsin . story_separator_special_tag common stock dividends - alliant energy announced a 6 % increase in its targeted 2018 annual common stock dividend to $ 1.34 per share , which is equivalent to a quarterly rate of $ 0.335 per share , beginning with the february 2018 dividend payment . the timing and amount of future dividends is subject to an approved dividend declaration from alliant energy 's board of directors , and is dependent upon earnings expectations , capital requirements , and general financial business conditions , among other factors . utility electric and gas margins - alliant energy and ipl currently expect an increase in electric and gas margins in 2018 compared to 2017 as a result of base rate increases from final rates implemented for ipl 's retail electric rate review ( 2016 test year ) and interim rates for ipl 's planned retail gas rate review ( 2017 test year ) . alliant energy and wpl currently expect an increase in electric margins from lower electric transmission service expense in 2018 compared to 2017 due to amortizations of previously over-recovered transmission expenses as approved in wpl 's retail electric rate review ( 2017/2018 test year ) . refer to “ rate matters ” for further discussion of these rate reviews . depreciation and amortization expenses - alliant energy and ipl currently expect an increase in depreciation and amortization expenses in 2018 compared to 2017 due to property additions , and the implementation of updated depreciation rates for ipl as a result of a recently completed depreciation study , which are currently expected to be effective in the first half of 2018. interest expense - alliant energy currently expects interest expense to increase in 2018 compared to 2017 primarily due to financings completed in 2017 and planned in 2018 as discussed above . afudc - alliant energy currently expects afudc to increase in 2018 compared to 2017 primarily due to increased cwip balances related to ipl 's expansion of wind generation and wpl 's west riverside facility . results of operations overview - “ executive overview ” provides an overview of alliant energy 's , ipl 's and wpl 's 2017 and 2016 earnings . additional earnings details for 2017 , 2016 and 2015 are discussed below . replace_table_token_39_th results of operations include financial information prepared in accordance with gaap as well as utility electric margins and utility gas margins , which are not measures of financial performance under gaap . utility electric margins are defined as electric operating revenues less electric production fuel , purchased power and electric transmission service expenses . utility gas margins are defined as gas operating revenues less cost of gas sold . utility electric margins and utility gas margins are non-gaap financial measures because they exclude other utility and non-utility operating revenues , other operation and maintenance expenses , depreciation and amortization expenses , and taxes other than income tax expense . management believes that utility electric and gas margins provide a meaningful basis for evaluating and managing utility operations since electric production fuel , purchased power and electric transmission service expenses and cost of gas sold are generally passed through to customers , and therefore , result in changes to electric and gas operating revenues that are comparable to changes in such expenses . the presentation of utility electric and gas margins herein is intended to provide supplemental information for investors regarding operating performance . these utility electric and gas margins may not be comparable to how other entities define utility electric and gas margin . furthermore , these measures are not intended to replace operating income as determined in accordance with gaap as an indicator of operating performance . operating income and a reconciliation of utility electric and gas margins to the most directly comparable gaap measure , operating income , was as follows ( in millions ) : replace_table_token_40_th operating income variances - variances between periods in operating income were as follows ( in millions ) : replace_table_token_41_th replace_table_token_42_th replace_table_token_43_th electric revenues and sales summary - electric revenues ( in millions ) , and mwh sales ( in thousands ) , were as follows : replace_table_token_44_th gas revenues and sales summary - gas revenues ( in millions ) , and dth sales ( in thousands ) , were as follows : replace_table_token_45_th temperatures - estimated increases ( decreases ) to electric and gas margins from the impacts of temperatures were as follows ( in millions ) : replace_table_token_46_th replace_table_token_47_th utility electric margin variances - the following items contributed to increased ( decreased ) utility electric margins as follows ( in millions ) : replace_table_token_48_th replace_table_token_49_th ( a ) wpl estimates the increase ( decrease ) to electric margins from amounts within the approved bandwidth of plus or minus 2 % of forecasted fuel-related expenses determined by the pscw each year was approximately ( $ 6 ) million , $ 6 million and $ 6 million in 2017 , 2016 and 2015 , respectively . ( b ) includes increases in temperature-normalized retail sales volumes at wpl in 2016. refer to “ electric sales trends ” below for more information . electric sales trends - alliant energy 's retail electric sales volumes decreased 1 % in 2017 and remained unchanged in 2016 . during 2017 , the decrease was primarily due to the impact of lower residential and commercial sales due to cooler summer temperatures during 2017 compared to the same period in 2016 and an extra day of retail sales during 2016 due to the leap year , partially offset by increases in wpl 's industrial sales from higher customer production and customer expansions . during 2016 , retail electric sales remained unchanged .
","planned utility rate reviews - ipl 's retail gas rate review ( 2017 test year ) - ipl currently expects to make a retail gas rate filing in the second quarter of 2018 based on a 2017 historical test year . the key drivers for the anticipated filing include recovery of capital projects , partially offset by the benefits of tax reform . any rate changes are expected to be implemented in two phases with interim rates effective approximately 10 days after the filing and final rates effective after iub approval . the iub must decide on requests for retail rate changes within 10 months of the date of the application for which changes are filed , or the interim rates granted become permanent . wpl 's retail electric and gas rate review ( 2019/2020 test period ) - wpl currently expects to make a retail electric and gas rate filing in the second quarter of 2018 for the 2019/2020 test period . the key drivers for the anticipated filing include recovery of capital projects , offset by the benefits of tax reform and fuel-related cost savings . any rate changes granted from this request are expected to be effective on january 1 , 2019. wpl currently expects a decision from the pscw regarding this rate filing by the end of 2018. replace_table_token_67_th rate review details - details related to ipl 's and wpl 's key jurisdictions were as follows ( common equity ( ce ) ; preferred equity ( pe ) ; long-term debt ( ld ) ; short-term debt ( sd ) ) : replace_table_token_68_th ( a ) authorized returns on common equity may not be indicative of actual returns earned or projections of future returns . ( b ) average rate base was calculated using balances as of the end of the test year , adjusted for post-test year capital additions placed in service by september 30 following the end of the test year .

"we will adopt this new accounting standard for the reporting periods beginning on january 1 , 2018 , using the full retrospective method to restate each prior reporting period presented . we have completed a review of our business processes , systems and controls as part of our effort to adopt the new revenue recognition standard and are executing on our developed project plan that includes analyzing the standard 's impact on our contract portfolio , comparing our historical policies and practices to the requirements of the new standard and identifying differences from applying the requirements of the new standard to our contracts . we have implemented necessary internal controls to ensure we adequately evaluate our portfolio of contracts under the five-step model promulgated by the fasb to ensure proper assessment of our operating results under the new standard . we do not expect a significant change in our control environment due to the adoption of the new standard ; however , we will continue to assess as we finalize the impact of the adoption story_separator_special_tag overview we are a leading private health insurance exchange for individuals , families and small businesses . through our website addresses ( www.ehealth.com , www.ehealthinsurance.com , www.ehealthmedicare.com , www.medicare.com , www.planprescriber.com and www.gomedigap.com ) , consumers can get quotes from leading health insurance carriers , compare plans side-by-side , and apply for and purchase medicare-related , individual and family , small business and ancillary health insurance plans . our ecommerce technology also enables us to deliver consumers ' health insurance applications electronically to health insurance carriers . as a result , we simplify and streamline the complex and traditionally paper-intensive health insurance sales and purchasing process . on january 22 , 2018 , we completed our acquisition of wealth , health and life advisors , llc , more commonly known as gomedigap , a technology-enabled provider of medicare supplement enrollment services . gomedigap has built a leading consumer acquisition and engagement platform focused on meeting the medicare supplement insurance needs of its individual customers with a technology-enabled , consumer-centric approach that aligns with our mission and operations . this strategic acquisition significantly enhances our growing presence in the medicare supplement market , puts us in a stronger position with carriers and strategic partners and allows us to accelerate our projected medicare plan enrollment growth in 2018 and beyond . for more information on our acquisition of gomedigap , see note 10-subsequent events in the notes to consolidated financial statements of this annual report on form 10-k . we have invested heavily in technology and content related to our ecommerce platforms . we have also invested significant time and resources in obtaining licenses to sell health insurance in all 50 states and the district of columbia , developing member acquisition programs , obtaining necessary regulatory approvals of our websites and establishing relationships and appointments with leading health insurance carriers , enabling us to offer thousands of health insurance plans online . our ecommerce platforms can be accessed directly through our websites as well as through our network of marketing partners . we operate as two distinct reporting segments : medicare and individual , family and small business . for more information on segment and geographic information , see note1-summary of business and significant accounting policies and note 9-operating segments , geographic information and significant customers in the notes to consolidated financial statements of this annual report on form 10-k. health care reform in march 2010 , the federal patient protection and affordable care act and related amendments in the health care and education reconciliation act were signed into law . these health care reform laws contain provisions that changed and will continue to change the health insurance industry in substantial ways . we have described various aspects of health care reform in part i , item 1 , business - health care reform and part i , item 1a , risk factors - risks related to our business . various aspects of health care reform may impact our business positively . for instance , the mandate that individuals and families have qualified health insurance or face a tax penalty and the government providing individuals and families ' subsidies in the form of premium tax credits and cost sharing reductions are provisions in the law that could benefit our business . the penalty for violating the mandate has been reduced to zero effective in 2019 , and notwithstanding these aspects of health care reform , the implementation of health care reform has significantly reduced our individual and family health insurance membership and commission revenue and could continue to have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations . the trump administration and republican leadership have repeatedly communicated their intention to alter or repeal the affordable care act , but their efforts to do so have so far been unsuccessful . as a part of the tax reform law that came into effect in december 2017 , the tax penalty for violating the individual mandate to have qualifying health insurance was reduced to zero effective in 2019 , essentially repealing it . the essential repeal of the individual mandate could have a further adverse impact on the individual and family health insurance market . in addition to the repeal of the mandate , the trump administration issued an executive order in october 2017 that directed the executive branch of the government to consider proposing regulations and revising guidance to expand access to association health plans , expand the availability of short term health 47 insurance and increase the usability of health reimbursement arrangements . as a result of the executive order , new regulations have been proposed that would facilitate association-based health insurance plans and promote the sale of more short term health insurance . the expansion of the use of short term health insurance may cause individuals and families to purchase short term health insurance instead of individual and family health insurance . story_separator_special_tag for ancillary health insurance plans ( such as short-term , dental , vision , accident and student ) , we take the sum of ( i ) the number of members for whom we have received or applied a commission payment for a month that is up to three months prior to the date of estimation ( after reducing that number using historical experience for assumed member cancellations over the period being estimated ) ; and ( ii ) the number of approved members over that period ( after reducing that number using historical experience for an assumed number of members who do not accept their approved policy from the same month of the previous year and for estimated member cancellations through the date of the estimate ) . to the extent we determine we have received substantially all of the commission payments related to a given month during the period being estimated , we will take the number of members for whom we have received or applied a commission payment during the month of estimation . the one to three-month period varies by insurance product and is largely dependent upon the timeliness of commission payment and related reporting from the related carriers . for small business health insurance plans , we estimate the number of members using the number of initial members at the time the group is approved , and we update this number for changes in membership if such changes are reported to us by the group or carrier in the period it is reported . however , groups generally notify the carrier directly of policy cancellations and increases or decreases in group size without informing us . health insurance carriers often do not communicate policy cancellation information or group size changes to us . we often are made aware of policy cancellations and group size changes at the time of annual renewal and update our membership statistics accordingly in the period they are reported . ( 9 ) estimated number of members active on all insurance plans as of the date indicated . see the notes ( 6 ) , ( 7 ) and ( 8 ) above for additional information regarding our calculation of total estimated membership . health insurance carrier 's bill and collect insurance premiums paid by our members . the carriers do not report to us the number of members that we have as of a given date . the majority of our members who terminate their policies do so by discontinuing their premium payments to the carrier and do not inform us of the cancellation . also , some of our members pay their premiums less frequently than monthly . given the number of months required to observe non-payment of commissions in order to confirm cancellations , we estimate the number of members who are active on insurance policies as of a specified date . after we have estimated membership for a period , we may receive information from health insurance carriers that would have impacted the estimate if we had received the information prior to the date of estimation . we may receive 49 commission payments or other information that indicates that a member who was not included in our estimates for a prior period was in fact an active member at that time , or that a member who was included in our estimates was in fact not an active member of ours . for instance , we reconcile information carriers provide to us and may determine that we were not historically paid commissions owed to us , which would cause us to have underestimated membership . conversely , carriers may require us to return commission payments paid in a prior period due to policy cancellations for members we previously estimated as being active . we do not update our estimated membership numbers reported in previous periods . instead , we reflect updated information regarding our historical membership in the membership estimate for the current period . as a result of the delay in our receipt of information from insurance carriers , actual trends in our membership are most discernible over periods longer than from one quarter to the next . as a result of the delay we experience in receiving information about our membership , it is difficult for us to determine with any certainty the impact of current conditions on our membership retention . health care reform and its impacts as well as other factors could cause the assumptions and estimates that we make in connection with estimating our membership to be inaccurate , which would cause our membership estimates to be inaccurate . member acquisition marketing initiatives are an important component of our strategy to increase revenue . our marketing initiatives are focused on three primary member acquisition channels : direct , marketing partners and online advertising and are primarily designed to encourage consumers to complete an application for health insurance . for the years ended december 31 , 2015 , 2016 and 2017 , applications submitted through us for medicare-related , individual and family , small business and ancillary health insurance products from our three member acquisition channels , expressed as a percentage of all health insurance applications submitted through us during the same periods , were as follows : replace_table_token_8_th factors influencing commission revenue our commission revenue is influenced by a number of factors including : the number of applications for medicare-related , individual , family and small business and ancillary health insurance we submit to health insurance carriers that are approved ; the rate at which the individuals on those applications turn into paying members ; the commission rates we receive for the health insurance plans that we sell ; and our membership retention . submitted applications .

thereto included in item 8 of this annual report . overview we provide one of the most popular content platforms , worldwide , centered on self-expression , attracting both creators looking to promote their content and consumers who utilize such content to express their identity , feelings , tastes and interests . today our platform enables consumers to personalize their mobile devices with free , high-quality ringtones , wallpapers , home screen app icons , widgets and notification sounds . our smartphone app , available in google play and itunes app stores , has been installed over 273 million times , has more than 31 million monthly active users and has averaged among the top 30 free applications in the google play store in the u.s. and in the itunes entertainment category for the past five years . to date , we have grown our user base without material investment in marketing , user acquisition or advertising . we generate over 90 % of our revenues from selling our advertising inventory to advertising networks , advertising exchanges , and direct arrangements with advertisers . advertising networks and advertising exchanges are third party technology platforms that facilitate the buying and selling of media advertising inventory from multiple ad networks . the price of advertising inventory is fixed on an advertising network whereas the price for inventory is determined through bidding on an advertising exchange . advertisers are attracted to us because of our sizable user base and our focus on mobile phone personalization . the remainder of our revenue is primarily generated from our managing and optimizing the advertising inventory of a third-party mobile application publisher , as well as overseeing the billing , collections and reporting related to advertising for this publisher . a key element in maintaining our competitive position is our ability to meet users ' expectations , which necessitates retaining employees with solid educational and professional credentials who are passionate about our mission to serve as a medium for self-expression . our ability to continue attracting advertisers depends on the growth and demographics of our user base , increased app usage and improved retention . these will require continued investment in product , technology and marketing . our growth plan also relies on diversifying our monetization portfolio and selective strategic investments and acquisitions . to this end we recently announced that in late 2017 we expect to rollout a marketplace where artists can monetize their digital creations . in order to accelerate this development we undertook the acquihire of freeform development , inc. we believe that this effort will both drive customer growth and introduce new revenue streams . we believe that our business model is scalable and allows for significant portions of revenue growth to flow to our bottom line . we were formerly a majority-owned subsidiary of idt corporation , or idt . on june 1 , 2016 , idt 's interest in zedge was spun-off by idt to idt 's stockholders and we became an independent public company through a pro rata distribution of our common stock held by idt to idt 's stockholders ( the spin-off ) . reportable segments our business consists of one reportable segment . critical accounting policies our financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america , or u.s. gaap . the preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets , liabilities , revenue and expenses as well as the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities . critical accounting policies are those that require application of management 's most subjective or complex judgments , often as a result of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods . our critical accounting policies include those related to capitalized software and technology development costs , revenue recognition and goodwill . management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances . actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions . see note 1 to the consolidated financial statements in this annual report for a complete discussion of our significant accounting policies . 20 capitalized software and technology development costs software and technology development activities generally fall into three stages : 1. planning stage activities include developing a project or business plan that outlines the goals for the content distribution platform or new product or service ; determining the functionality ; identifying hardware and software applications that will achieve functionality , security , and traffic flows ; and selecting the

in august 2017 , the financial accounting standards board ( “ fasb ” ) issued an asu intended to improve the financial reporting of hedging relationships to better portray the economic results of an entity 's risk management activities in its financial statements . in addition , the asu includes certain targeted improvements to simplify the application of hedge accounting guidance in u.s. gaap . the amendments in this asu are effective for the company on august 1 , 2019. early application is permitted . entities will apply the amendments to cash flow and net investment hedge relationships that exist on the date of adoption using a modified retrospective approach . the presentation and disclosure requirements will be applied prospectively . the company is evaluating the impact that this asu will have on its consolidated financial statements . in may 2017 , the fasb issued an asu to provide guidance about which changes to the terms or conditions of a share-based payment award require an entity to apply modification accounting . pursuant to this asu , an entity should account for the effects of a modification unless all the following are met : ( 1 ) the fair value ( or calculated value or intrinsic value , if such an alternative measurement method is used ) of the modified award is the same as the fair value ( or calculated value or intrinsic value , if such an alternative measurement method is used ) of the original award immediately before the original award is modified ( if the modification does not affect any of the inputs to the valuation technique that the entity uses to value the award , the entity is not required to estimate the value immediately before and after the modification ) ; ( 2 ) the vesting conditions of the modified award are the same as the vesting conditions of the original award immediately before the original award is modified ; and ( 3 ) the classification of the modified award as an equity instrument or a liability instrument is the same as the classification of the original award immediately before the original award is modified . we will adopt the amendments in this asu prospectively to an award modified on or after on august 1 , 2018. we are evaluating the impact that the new standard will have on our consolidated financial statements . in january 2017 , the fasb issued an asu to clarify the definition of a business with the objective of adding guidance to assist entities with evaluating whether transactions should be accounted for as acquisitions ( or disposals ) of assets or businesses . under the current guidance , there are three elements of a business—inputs , processes , and outputs . while an integrated set of assets and activities ( collectively referred to as a “ set ” ) that is a business usually has outputs , outputs are not required to be present . in addition , all the inputs and processes that a seller uses in operating a set are not required if market participants can acquire the set and continue to produce outputs , for example , by integrating the acquired set with their own inputs and processes . the amendments in this asu provide a screen to determine when a set is not a business . the screen requires that when substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets acquired ( or disposed of ) is concentrated in a single identifiable asset or a group of similar identifiable assets , the set is not a business . this screen reduces the number of transactions that need to be further evaluated . if the screen is not met , the amendments in this asu ( 1 ) require that to be considered a business , a set must include , at a minimum , an input and a substantive process that together significantly contribute to the ability to create output and ( 2 ) remove the evaluation of whether a market participant could replace missing elements . the amendments provide a framework to assist entities in evaluating whether both an input and a substantive process are present . the framework includes two sets of criteria to consider that depend on whether a set has outputs . although outputs are not required for a set to be a business , outputs generally are a key element of a business ; therefore , the fasb has developed more stringent criteria for sets without outputs . lastly , the asu narrows the definition of the term output . we will adopt the amendments in this asu on august 1 , 2018. we are evaluating the impact that the new standard will have on our consolidated financial statements . in june 2016 , the fasb issued an asu that changes the impairment model for most financial assets and certain other instruments . for receivables , loans and other instruments , entities will be required to use a new forward-looking “ expected loss ” model that generally will result in the earlier recognition of allowance for losses . for available-for-sale debt securities with unrealized losses , entities will measure credit losses in a manner similar to current practice , except the losses will be recognized as allowances instead of reductions in the amortized cost of the securities . in addition , an entity will have to disclose significantly more information about allowances , credit quality indicators and past due securities . the new provisions will be applied as a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings . we will adopt the new standard on august 1 , 2020. we are evaluating the impact that the new standard will have on our consolidated financial statements . 22 in february 2016 , the fasb issued asu related to the accounting for leases .
","results of operations fiscal year ended july 31 , 2017 compared to fiscal year ended july 31 , 2016 replace_table_token_1_th revenues . revenues decreased in fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016 primarily due to a 9.3 % decline in our average revenue per monthly active user derived from our apps , or arpmau , to $ 0.0244 from $ 0.0269. the app arpmau decrease was mainly due to a 9.9 % decline in monthly active users , or mau ( which is a performance indicator that captures the number of unique users that opened our app in the previous 30-day period in more developed markets where we are able to command higher advertising rates ; our decision to reduce our investments in our game channel in mid-april 2016 , which resulted in a decline in game installs for which we are paid on a “ cost per install ” basis ; and to not fully recovering from our app being temporarily removed from the itunes store on february 1 , 2016. in response to the removal from the itunes store , we introduced a standalone wallpaper app in itunes in march 2016 offering free wallpapers , a standalone ringtone app in itunes in december 2016 offering free ringtones , and a premium ringtone app in april 2017 featuring for-purchase remixes of music from chart topping artists . the rollout of these individual apps was done in order to both fully comply with itunes terms and conditions as well as mitigate risk . the premium ringtone app was also introduced in order to experiment with a paid content monetization capability and to offer tap-to-set ease of use and generate revenues from sources other than advertising . in mid-december 2016 , we launched a new ad strategy with our wallpaper and ringtones apps , intended to improve user engagement .

"internal software costs are amortized over a period of three years and , in accordance with the project type story_separator_special_tag f financial condition and results of operations the following is management 's discussion and analysis of certain significant factors that have affected unifi 's operations , along with material changes in financial condition , during the periods included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements . management 's discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the remainder of this annual report , with the understanding that “ forward-looking statements ” may be present . a reference to a “ note ” refers to the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements . overview unifi sells polyester-based and nylon-based products primarily to other yarn manufacturers and knitters and weavers that produce fabric for the apparel , hosiery , home furnishings , automotive , industrial and other end-use markets . polyester yarns include poy , textured , solution and package dyed , twisted , beamed and draw wound yarns , and each is available in virgin or recycled varieties . recycled solutions , made from both pre-consumer and post-consumer waste , include plastic bottle flake and chip . nylon products include textured , solution dyed and spandex covered yarns . unifi maintains one of the textile industry 's most comprehensive yarn product offerings that include specialized yarns , pva yarns and commodity yarns , with principal geographic markets in the americas and asia . unifi has manufacturing operations in four countries and participates in joint ventures in israel and the united states , the most significant of which is a 34 % non-controlling partnership interest in pal , a significant unconsolidated affiliate that produces cotton and synthetic yarns for sale to the global textile industry and apparel market . we believe the investment in pal provides strategic diversification for our overall business in response to global textile trends . unifi has three reportable segments - the polyester segment , the nylon segment and the international segment – as well as certain ancillary operations that include for-hire transportation services , which comprise an all other category . the ancillary operations classified within all other are insignificant for all periods presented ; therefore , our discussion and analysis of those activities is generally limited to their impact on consolidated results , where appropriate . unifi reported net income of $ 32,875 , or $ 1.81 per basic share , for fiscal 2017. such results reflect growth in sales of pva products , especially in the international segment , which was partially offset by ( i ) a difficult domestic environment , ( ii ) increased sg & a expenses for strategic planning , talent acquisition and commercial expansion and ( iii ) lower earnings from equity affiliates . additionally , in fiscal 2017 , unifi faced periods of fluctuating virgin polyester raw material costs , temporarily depressing the polyester segment 's gross margins , but benefited from ( a ) the recognition of a benefit for bad debts , ( b ) a lower effective tax rate and ( c ) favorable foreign currency exchange rates . the international segment continued strong performance and growth due to the global success of unifi 's pva portfolio , along with the shutdown of a competitor in brazil in early calendar 2016. the polyester and nylon segments both experienced a difficult domestic environment , challenged by weak retail selling seasons and cautious ordering patterns from brands and retailers . significant developments and trends unifi 's operations in fiscal 2017 were focused on enhancing the global supply chain , growing the market for its pva products and using cash flow from operations to fund select capital projects and strategic growth opportunities . this focus led to the continuing increase in unifi 's pva sales as a percentage of its overall sales , with net sales from pva products representing approximately 40 % of consolidated net sales for fiscal 2017. this continues a growth trend of between 10 % and 15 % over the past several fiscal years . unifi 's strategy of enriching its product mix through a focus on pva products helps insulate it from the pressures of low-priced commodity yarn imports and helps to establish unifi as an innovation leader in its core markets . unifi 's innovative and sustainable products achieved growth in overseas markets , continuing to meet the demands of premier brands and retailers worldwide . 22 unifi 's flagship repreve ® brand continued as our fastest growing pva solution during fiscal 2017. the increasing success and awarenes s of the repreve ® brand continues to provide new opportunities for growth , allowing for expansion into new end-uses and markets for repreve ® , as well as continuing to grow the brand with current customers . both brands and consumers are demanding more susta inable solutions that provide better performance characteristics , and repreve ® is positioned to benefit from this trend . fiscal 2017 marked the third year of a three-year $ 135,000 capital investment plan . beginning with fiscal 2015 , unifi invested approximately $ 35,000 in capital projects , adding machinery to support expansion of its draw-textured and air-jet textured businesses , launching its third production line in the repreve ® recycling center and installing a 1-megawatt capacity solar farm . in fiscal 2016 , unifi invested approximately $ 60,000 in capital projects , including the bottle processing facility , commencing another repreve ® recycling center expansion and enhancing automation systems and existing machinery to handle the increasingly complex product mix . unifi invested approximately $ 40,000 in capital projects in fiscal 2017 , completing construction of its bottle processing facility , nearing completion of the fourth production line in the repreve ® recycling center , and completing construction of assets for production of specialized fibers in partnership with eastman chemical company , along with additional enhancements to existing assets for customized and small-lot solutions . story_separator_special_tag management uses adjusted ebitda ( i ) as a measurement of operating performance because it assists us in comparing our operating performance on a consistent basis , as it removes the impact of ( a ) items directly related to our asset base ( primarily depreciation and amortization ) and ( b ) items that we would not expect to occur as a part of our normal business on a regular basis ; ( ii ) for planning purposes , including the preparation of our annual operating budget ; ( iii ) as a valuation measure for evaluating our operating performance and our capacity to incur and service debt , fund capital expenditures and expand our business ; and ( iv ) as one measure in determining the value of other acquisitions and dispositions . adjusted ebitda is a key performance metric utilized in the determination of variable compensation . we also believe adjusted ebitda is an appropriate supplemental measure of debt service capacity , because it serves as a high-level proxy for cash generated from operations and is relevant to our fixed charge coverage ratio . equity in earnings of pal is excluded from adjusted ebitda because such earnings do not reflect our operating performance . management uses adjusted net income and adjusted eps ( i ) as measurements of net operating performance because they assist us in comparing such performance on a consistent basis , as they remove the impact of ( a ) items that we would not expect to occur as a part of our normal business on a regular basis and ( b ) components of the provision for income taxes that we would not expect to occur as a part of our underlying taxable operations ; ( ii ) for planning purposes , including the preparation of our annual operating budget ; and ( iii ) as measures in determining the value of other acquisitions and dispositions . historically , ebitda , adjusted ebitda , adjusted net income and adjusted eps aimed to exclude the impact of the non-controlling interest in renewables , while the consolidated amounts for such entity were required to be included in unifi 's financial amounts reported under gaap . see “ — non-gaap reconciliations ” below for reconciliations of non-gaap metrics to the most directly comparable gaap metric . 25 non-gaap reconciliations ebitda and adjusted ebitda the reconciliations of the amounts reported under gaap for net income to ebitda and adjusted ebitda are as follows : replace_table_token_6_th amounts presented in the reconciliation above may not be consistent with amounts included in unifi 's consolidated financial statements due to the impact of the non-controlling interest in renewables . adjusted net income and adjusted eps the tables below set forth reconciliations of ( i ) income before income taxes ( “ pre-tax income ” ) , provision for income taxes ( “ tax impact ” ) and net income to adjusted net income and ( ii ) basic eps to adjusted eps . replace_table_token_7_th replace_table_token_8_th 26 replace_table_token_9_th ( 1 ) for the fiscal year ended june 25 , 2017 , the company incurred a loss on the sale of its investment in renewables of $ 1,662. there is no tax impact for this transaction as the loss is non-deductible . ( 2 ) for the fiscal year ended june 26 , 2016 , the company incurred key employee transition costs of $ 2,330 , before tax , for transactions in the united states . the company estimates the tax benefit of these costs was $ 673 , using a 35 % tax rate , with no significant deferred tax components . including transactions for renewables , the amounts reflected here consider impacts to the valuation allowances and non-controlling interest . ( 3 ) the bargain purchase gains recognized for an equity affiliate did not generate a tax impact for purposes of this reconciliation as the corresponding change in deferred tax expense is offset by a change in the valuation allowance for unifi 's investment in the equity affiliate . 27 review of fiscal 2017 results of operations compared to fiscal 2016 consolidated overview the components of net income , each component as a percentage of net sales and the percentage increase or decrease over the prior fiscal year amounts are presented in the table below . fiscal 2017 and 2016 both are comprised of 52 weeks . replace_table_token_10_th consolidated net sales consolidated net sales for fiscal 2017 increased by $ 3,633 , or 0.6 % , as compared to fiscal 2016. consolidated sales volumes increased 11.3 % , attributable to continued growth in sales of pva products in the international segment and sales of polyester chip and plastic bottle flake in the polyester segment . in brazil , despite a volatile economic and political environment , we capitalized on expansion of the synthetic yarn market coupled with market share gain due to the shutdown of a competitor in early calendar 2016. in asia , the business has grown as brands and retail partners continue to utilize our global model , providing differentiation and innovation of our pva products to support customers ' global supply chains . the increase in international segment sales volumes was partially offset by softness in the retail markets covered by nafta and cafta-dr , which adversely impacted the polyester and nylon segments . as store closures and other business transformations plagued the retail industry , domestic apparel brands and retailers continued a cautious ordering level throughout fiscal 2017 , which led to sales volume declines for our domestic operations compared to the prior period . we believe the difficult domestic retail environment has become a pervasive and disruptive issue for the textile supply chain , and although the unfavorable conditions were present in both fiscal 2016 and 2017 , we have not identified this issue as a long-term trend .
","ty summary unifi has met its historical liquidity requirements for working capital , capital expenditures , debt service requirements and other operating needs from its cash flows from operations and available borrowings . unifi believes that its existing cash balances , cash provided by operating activities , and borrowings available under the abl revolver will enable unifi to comply with the terms of its indebtedness and meet its foreseeable liquidity requirements . domestically , unifi 's cash balances , cash provided by operating activities and borrowings available under the abl revolver continue to be sufficient to fund unifi 's domestic operating activities as well as cash commitments for its investing and financing activities . for its existing foreign operations , unifi expects its existing cash balances and cash provided by operating activities will provide the needed liquidity to fund its foreign operating activities and any foreign investing activities , such as future capital expenditures . however , expansion of our foreign operations may require cash sourced from our domestic subsidiaries . cash provided by operating activities the significant components of net cash provided by operating activities are summarized below . unifi analyzes net cash provided by operating activities utilizing the major components of the statements of cash flows prepared under the indirect method . replace_table_token_30_th fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016 the decrease in net cash provided by operating activities from fiscal 2016 to fiscal 2017 is primarily due to an increase in working capital in fiscal 2017 , as indicated in the other changes above . such increase in working capital is primarily attributable to an increase in inventories due to comparatively higher international sales and an increase in income taxes receivable .

"changes in story_separator_special_tag critical accounting policies and estimates the company 's consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america , and the company follows general practices within the financial services industry in which it operates . at times the application of these principles requires management to make assumptions , estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes . these assumptions , estimates and judgments are based on information available as of the date of the financial statements . as this information changes , the financial statements could reflect different assumptions , estimates and judgments . certain policies inherently have a greater reliance on assumptions , estimates and judgments and as such have a greater possibility of producing results that could be materially different than originally reported . examples of critical assumptions , estimates and judgments are when assets and liabilities are required to be recorded at fair value , when a decline in the value of an asset not required to be recorded at fair value warrants an impairment write-down or valuation reserve to be established , or when an asset or liability must be recorded contingent upon a future event . 21 all sig nificant accounting policies followed by the company are presented in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements . these policies , along with the disclosures presented in the notes to the consolidated financial statements and in the management discussi on and analysis of financial condition and results of operations , provide information on how significant assets and liabilities are valued and how those values are determined for the financial statements . based on the valuation techniques used and the sens itivity of financial statement amounts to assumptions , estimates and judgments underlying those amounts , management has identified the determination of the allowance for loan and lease losses ( alll ) and the valuation of its mortgage servicing rights ( msr ) and other real estate owned ( oreo ) as the accounting areas that requires the most subjective or complex judgments , and as such could be the most subject to revision as new information becomes available . oreo , which is comprised of assets acquired by the bank , through , or in lieu of , loan foreclosure are held for sale and are initially recorded at fair value at the date of foreclosure . subsequent to foreclosure , valuations are periodically performed by management and the assets are carried at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell . the alll represents management 's estimate of credit losses inherent in the bank 's loan portfolio at the report date . the estimate is a composite of a variety of factors including experience , collateral value , and the general economy . alll includes a specific portion , a formula driven portion , and a general nonspecific portion . the collection and ultimate recovery of the book value of the collateral , in most cases , is beyond our control . the company is also required to estimate the value of its msr . the company recognizes as separate assets rights to service fixed rate single-family mortgage loans that it has sold without recourse but services for others for a fee . mortgage servicing assets are initially recorded at fair value , based upon pricing multiples as determined by the purchaser , when the loans are sold . mortgage servicing assets are carried at the lower of the initial carrying value , adjusted for amortization , or estimated fair value . amortization is determined in proportion to and over the period of estimated net servicing income using the level yield method . for purposes of determining impairment , the mortgage servicing assets are stratified into like groups based on loan type , term , new versus seasoned and interest rate . the valuation is completed by an independent third party . the expected and actual rates of mortgage loan prepayments are the most significant factors driving the potential for the impairment of the value of mortgage servicing assets . increases in mortgage loan prepayments reduce estimated future net servicing cash flows because the life of the underlying loan is reduced . the company 's mortgage servicing rights relating to loans serviced for others represent an asset of the company . this asset is initially capitalized and included in other assets on the company 's consolidated balance sheet . the mortgage servicing rights are then amortized as noninterest expense in proportion to , and over the period of , the estimated future net servicing income of the underlying mortgage servicing rights . there are a number of factors , however , that can affect the ultimate value of the mortgage servicing rights to the company , including the estimated prepayment speed of the loan and the discount rate used to present value the servicing right . for example , if the mortgage loan is prepaid , the company will receive fewer servicing fees , meaning that the present value of the mortgage servicing rights is less than the carrying value of those rights on the company 's balance sheet . therefore , in an attempt to reflect an accurate expected value to the company of the mortgage servicing rights , the company receives a valuation of its mortgage servicing rights from an independent third party . the independent third party 's valuation of the mortgage servicing rights is based on relevant characteristics of the company 's loan servicing portfolio , such as loan terms , interest rates and recent national prepayment experience , as well as current national market interest rate levels , market forecasts and other economic conditions . management , with the advice from its third party valuation firm , review the assumptions related to prepayment speeds , discount rates , and capitalized mortgage servicing income on a quarterly basis . changes are reflected in the following quarter 's analysis related to the mortgage servicing asset . story_separator_special_tag f & m being a community bank has played well with borrowers who desire a banking relationship and not a transactional bank . during the first quarter of 2019 , we opened a new office in decatur , indiana that had been in process at the time of the acquisition . this office utilizes itm equipment , offering traditional service with a self-service option . an itm completes teller transactions using a debit card for recognition - the self-service option . the traditional service completes the transaction by the customer requesting teller assistance and talking to a remote customer assistance representative on-line . personal relationship bankers ( prbs ) welcome our customers to the office and provide exceptional customer service as they can complete a teller transaction , open a new deposit account and complete a consumer loan . one additional existing office was physically transformed during 2019 with itms . our other offices have begun the personnel transformations with prbs at each 23 office and community relationship bankers ( crbs ) covering specific market areas . crbs focus on the community and especially small business customers . f & m strives to serve our customers where they want , and how they want . a trend of increasing improvement in net income continued from 2017 through 2019 . 2019 increased 23.1 % over 2018 and 2018 was 17.5 % higher than 2017. dividends declared also increased over the corresponding years . 2019 's declared dividends at $ 0.61 a share was 8.9 % higher than 2018 's $ 0.56 per share and 2018 was 12.0 % higher than 2017 's $ 0.50 per share . the company remains strong , stable and well capitalized and has the capacity to continue to cover the increased costs of doing business . the company continues to look for new opportunities to generate and protect revenue while providing additional channels through which to serve our customer and maintain our high level of customer satisfaction . the company plans to continue our strategy of expansion into new markets , whether by acquisition or the establishment of new branch office locations . a new office in fort wayne , indiana is underway for 2020 expansion . story_separator_special_tag had three rate decreases of 25 basis points . the large revenue gain in loan interest was aided by the increased earnings in securities of $ 678 thousand . the overall asset yield in 2019 improved by 39 basis points over 2018 . increased interest expense correlated to the higher rate environment in which the deposits needed to be garnered . the bank experienced pressure to offer higher rates to public funds in ohio due to competition . in the area where the strategic plan was to gather core deposits , the average balance in savings grew by $ 169.1 million during 2019 as compared to 2018 's average balance . the other average balance increase for core deposits was the change in non-interest bearing demand deposits . 2019 's average balance in this portfolio was $ 49.0 million higher than 2018 's average balance . overall , cost of funds increased 56 basis points for 2019 over 2018. the reason behind the increase was largely due to rate increases , not the volume increases . the net interest margin for 2019 was 3.80 % compared to 2018 which was 3.83 % . the 0.03 % decrease for 2019 was directly related to the increased interest expense . net interest spread was 3.43 % for 2019 compared to 2018 's 3.60 % , creating a 17 basis point difference in the spread . loans as a percentage of earning assets was 79.9 % while loans to total assets was 75.3 % for 2019. the goal is , as always , to improve the net interest margin and spread and thereby improve profitability . in comparing 2018 to 2017 , loan volume was primarily responsible for the improvement in interest income as the yield on the overall loan portfolio increased 33 basis points during 2018 . the only category of asset yield to decrease was the investment securities which were used to fund growth . overall , asset yield increased 30 basis points in 2018 as compared to 2017 . the net interest margin also climbed up in 2018 , ending 18 basis points over 2017. asset yield raised 30 basis points while the cost of funds increased 18 basis points . the yields on the individual segments did cause the overall improvement as all increased with the exception of tax exempt securities . the improvement in the asset yield was primarily a result of the change in rate . in addition , loans as a percentage of earning assets increased to 79.3 % in 2018 compared to 77.8 % in 2017 . loans to total assets also increased to 74.8 % for 2018 compared to 2017 's 72.8 % . overall yield improves when the balances of the highest yield asset increases , which is loans . with respect to the cost of funds , the bank 's goal is to grow the least expensive category of funding sources . the largest average balance increase for 2018 was $ 32.2 million in savings deposits over 2017 's average balances . this growth was mostly responsible for the increase in funding expense of 18 basis points when comparing 2018 to 2017. the company will always prefer to see improvement in real dollars over percentages . the strategy for increasing core deposits , in order to mitigate the higher cost of funds and to continue to establish the opportunity for fee dollars from services provided , remains for 2020. total assets of the company increased overall as did the earning assets in both average and year end during 2019 and 2018. this matched the movement in interest dollars and in yields . the percentage of average earning assets to total average assets reflects the best utilization of funds . for 2019 , the percentage at 94.26 % was only slightly higher than 2018 at 94.23 % .
","material changes in results of operations net interest income the discussion now centers on the individual line items of the consolidated statement of income and their effect on net income . this section will focus on the most traditional source of revenue contributing to the profitability of the company which is net interest income . net interest income is the difference between interest income earned on interest earning assets , such as loans and securities , and interest expense paid on interest bearing liabilities used to fund those assets , such as interest bearing deposits and other borrowings . net interest income is affected by changes in both interest rates and the amount and composition of earning assets and liabilities . the change in net interest income is most often measured by two statistics – interest spread and net interest margin . the difference between the yields earned on earning assets and the rates paid for interest bearing liabilities represents the interest spread . the net interest margin is the difference of funds ( interest expense ) between the yield on earning assets and the cost as a percentage of earning assets . because noninterest bearing sources of funds such as demand deposits and stockholders ' equity also support earning assets , the net interest margin exceeds the net interest spread . as mentioned previously , the largest factor of the record earnings for 2019 was the $ 13.7 million improvement in net interest income as compared to 2018. in 2018 , net interest income increased $ 3.7 million as compared to 2017 . interest and fee income from loans were responsible for the improvement . interest income from loans , including fees , increased $ 19.9 million in 2019 as compared to 2018 . this was preceded by an increase in 2018 of $ 5.1 million as compared to 2017 .

chairman of the scientific games board and macandrews & forbes chairman and ceo , as well as barry schwartz and frances townsend , the two other macandrews & forbes representatives , resigned from the board effective september 16 , 2020. impacts of covid-19 in march 2020 , the world health organization declared the rapidly spreading covid-19 outbreak a pandemic . in response to the covid-19 pandemic , governments across the world implemented a number of measures to prevent its spread , including but not limited to , the temporary closure of a substantial number of gaming operations establishments and disruptions to lottery operations , travel restrictions , and cancellation of sporting events , which are affecting our business segments in a number of ways . during the latter part of the second quarter and throughout the remainder of 2020 , lifting of restrictions began , 51 including the reopening of the majority of gaming establishments globally and resumption of sporting events . during the fourth quarter of 2020 and in the response to the second wave of the covid-19 pandemic , certain jurisdictions implemented additional temporary closures . story_separator_special_tag the 2020 charges are a result of a strategic revision of product roadmaps , and assessments related to how many and which platforms we will support , when we end service on legacy platforms and when we stop selling such platforms in conjunction with new product launches . the implementation of our strategic revision combined with the rapid erosion of market demand that took place in 2020 ( due to covid-19 disruptions ) , our increased focus on our go to market approach in latam ( due to covid-19 disruptions and the overall macro economic impact on the latam region ) , and our revised outlook on certain markets and customers , required us to reassess our inventory valuation . we determined we had excess or obsolete inventory based on the new strategy , a reduction in demand for legacy platforms , and projections for the disposition of the related inventory . in addition , the continued closures in the latam region made it difficult to execute our previous strategy of shipping legacy platforms into that market . the combination of these factors led to the $ 48 million inventory valuation charge recognized during 2020. our policy is to continually review and assess these and other factors , and if such factors or our outlook changes , we will record further adjustments to the valuation of inventory . our lottery business segment has experienced relative growth and recovery as the shelter in place orders and lockdowns have been eased back resulting in increased foot traffic and more spending by end players , coupled with international retail establishments that have now substantially re-opened . lottery sales were down meaningfully initially as a result of the pandemic , but have since largely recovered in the u.s. and international markets . the temporary closure of gaming operations , disruptions to lottery operations , travel restrictions , cancellation of sporting events , lower disposable incomes of consumers and the adverse impact on our casino and gaming customers ' liquidity and financial results caused by the covid-19 pandemic , had an adverse effect on our results of operations , cash flows and financial condition throughout 2020 and we anticipate will continue to a lesser degree into 2021. although the majority of gaming and lottery operations have re-opened , with encouraging initial results , we are unable to determine the ultimate magnitude and the length of time that the pandemic disruptions will continue to impact our results of operations , cash flows and financial condition , which will depend , among other factors , on the currently unknowable duration of the covid-19 pandemic , the impact of governmental regulations and actions that might continue to be imposed in response to the pandemic , change in customer behaviors , social distancing measures , decreased gaming establishments operating capacity , high unemployment rates , and the pace of overall recovery of gaming and lottery operations globally . we implemented a number of measures to reduce operating costs and conserve liquidity including permanent reductions in workforce and temporary measures such as : reductions in salaries and workforce ( all salaries back to 100 % as of july 31 , 2020 ) , unpaid employee furloughs , temporary elimination of 401 ( k ) matching among other compensation and benefits reductions and deferral of all non-essential operating and capital expenditures . these measures , combined with the above , have resulted in substantial cost savings in 2020. additionally , reduced capital expenditures and the above measures are expected to result in an overall lower future cost structure . financings and capital markets transactions during the year , we borrowed $ 530 million under sgi 's revolving credit facility , and made payments of $ 190 million , including a voluntary $ 100 million payment in the fourth quarter of 2020 , against the balance drawn on the revolving credit facility . as of december 31 , 2020 , our total available liquidity ( excluding our sciplay business segment ) was $ 850 million . in february of 2021 , we made another voluntary payment of $ 100 million on sgi 's revolving credit facility . we amended the consolidated net first lien leverage ratio covenant in the credit agreement with the requisite lenders under sgi 's revolving credit facility on may 8 , 2020 ( the “ credit agreement amendment ” ) and subsequently extended the credit agreement amendment on october 8 , 2020 ( the “ credit agreement extension amendment ” ) to implement a financial covenant relief period , which extends the relief period through the first quarter of 2022. as a result , ( a ) sgi is not required to maintain compliance with the consolidated net first lien leverage ratio covenant during the covenant relief period , ( b ) the step down of the consolidated net first lien leverage ratio covenant following the covenant relief period was revised , ( c ) sgi must maintain liquidity ( excluding sciplay ) of at least $ 275 million during the covenant relief period , ( d ) sgi is restricted in its ability to further incur indebtedness and liens , make restricted payments and investments and prepay junior indebtedness during the covenant relief period , subject to certain exceptions and further subject , in some instances , to maintaining minimum liquidity ( excluding sciplay ) of at least $ 400 million and ( e ) a libor floor of 0.500 % was established on borrowings under the revolving credit facility during the covenant relief period .
","cash flow summary replace_table_token_8_th year ended december 31 , 2020 compared to year ended december 31 , 2019 cash flows from operating activities net cash provided by operating activities decreased in 2020 primarily due to lower cash earnings impacted by the 73 covid-19 business disruptions . the changes in our working capital accounts for the year ended december 31 , 2020 were primarily driven by the following : $ 121 million favorable change in receivables due to timing of collections and lower billing primarily associated with gaming segment receivables ; $ 14 million favorable change in inventory due to timing of orders and shipments ; $ 35 million unfavorable change in other current assets and liabilities primarily related to increases in various prepaid expenses and timing of contract assets and liabilities ; $ 60 million favorable change in accounts payable and accrued liabilities primarily as a result of the timing of expenditures . cash flows from investing activities net cash used in investing activities decreased primarily due to lower capital expenditures and proceeds received from the sale of certain properties in chicago , which was partially offset by sciplay 's acquisition of come2play . capital expenditures are composed of investments in systems , equipment and other assets related to contracts , property and equipment , intangible assets and software . cash flows from financing activities net cash provided by financing activities increased primarily due to the $ 340 million net draw on sgi 's revolving credit facility , while the prior year included $ 342 million in proceeds from the sale of sciplay common stock , which were partially offset by $ 253 million in net payments on long-term debt and $ 23 million in debt issuance , deferred financing and offering costs .

"5. note payable and accrued expenses ( a ) note payable on september 30 , 2014 , the company executed a loan and security agreement with oxford finance llc ( oxford ) . under the agreement , story_separator_special_tag . overview we are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery , development and commercialization of novel therapeutics for oncology and rare diseases . we use two distinct proprietary drug discovery technology platforms to design and develop drug candidates : our toll-like receptor , or tlr , targeting technology and our third-generation antisense , or 3ga , technology , which we previously referred to as our gso technology . we developed these platforms based on our scientific expertise and pioneering work with synthetic oligonucleotides as therapeutic agents . using our tlr targeting technology , we design synthetic oligonucleotide-based drug candidates to modulate the activity of specific tlrs . in addition , using our 3ga technology , we are developing drug candidates to turn off the messenger rna , or mrna , associated with disease causing genes . we believe that our 3ga technology may potentially reduce the immunotoxicity and increase the potency of earlier generation antisense and rna interference , or rnai , technologies . we are focused on the development of drug candidates for oncology and rare diseases characterized by small , well-defined patient populations with serious unmet medical needs . we plan to explore potential collaborative alliances to support late-stage development and commercialization of some of our drug candidates . we are developing imo-8400 for the treatment of certain b-cell lymphomas in which the myd88 l265p oncogenic mutation is present . oncogenic mutations are changes in the dna of tumor cells that promote the survival and proliferation of tumor cells . myd88 is an adaptor protein in the tlr signaling pathway that mediates tlr signaling . the myd88 l265p oncogenic mutation has been reported to lead to increased tlr signaling and malignant proliferation in certain b-cell lymphomas , including waldenström 's macroglobulinemia , diffuse large b-cell lymphoma , or dlbcl , and other forms of b-cell malignancies , including burkitt 's lymphoma , cutaneous diffuse large b-cell lymphoma ( leg type ) , chronic lymphocytic leukemia , gastric mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma , marginal zone lymphoma , and splenic marginal zone lymphoma . our pipeline of drug candidates includes imo-2125 and imo-2055 , two tlr9 agonists that may have potential applications as immune therapies for the treatment of cancer . recent advancements in cancer immunotherapy have included the approval and late-stage development of multiple checkpoint inhibitors , which are therapies that target mechanisms by which tumor cells evade detection by the immune system . because tlr9 agonists stimulate the immune system , we believe that there is a scientific rationale to evaluate the combination of our tlr9 agonists with checkpoint inhibitors . in independent research in preclinical cancer models , intratumoral injection of tlr9 agonists has potentiated the anti-tumor activity of checkpoint inhibitors . we have selected dermatomyositis as the first non-cancer rare disease for application of imo-8400 . we selected this indication for development based on the reported role of tlrs in the pathogenesis of the disease state , clinical feasibility , including ease of patient identification and availability of endpoints for regulatory approval and commercial potential . we are developing our 3ga technology to turn off the mrna associated with disease causing genes . we have designed 3ga oligonucleotides to specifically address challenges associated with earlier generation antisense and rnai technologies . although currently used technologies to silence rna have demonstrated the ability to inhibit the expression of disease-associated proteins , we believe that to reach their full therapeutic potential , gene silencing technologies need to achieve an improved therapeutic index with efficient systemic delivery , reduced immunotoxicity and increased potency . we have designed our 3ga oligonucleotides to provide these attributes . at december 31 , 2015 , we had an accumulated deficit of $ 500.1 million . we expect to incur substantial operating losses in future periods . we do not expect to generate product revenue , sales-based milestones or royalties until we successfully complete development and obtain marketing approval for drug candidates , either alone or in collaborations with third parties , which we expect will take a number of years . in order to commercialize our drug candidates , we need to complete clinical development and to comply with comprehensive regulatory requirements . 58 critical accounting policies and estimates this management 's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our financial statements , which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states . the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period . on an ongoing basis , management evaluates its estimates and judgments , including those related to stock-based compensation . management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances , the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources . actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions . we regard an accounting estimate or assumption underlying our financial statements as a critical accounting estimate where : the nature of the estimate or assumption is material due to the level of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change ; and the impact of the estimates and assumptions on financial condition or operating performance is material . story_separator_special_tag our assumed dividend yield of zero is based on the fact that we have never paid cash dividends to common stockholders and have no present intention to pay cash dividends . we use an expected option life based on actual experience . our assumption for expected volatility is based on the actual stock-price volatility over a period equal to the expected life of the option . if factors change and we employ different assumptions for estimating stock-based compensation expense in future periods , or if we decide to use a different valuation model , the stock-based compensation expense we recognize in future periods may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current period and could materially affect our operating income ( loss ) , net income ( loss ) and earnings ( loss ) per share . it may also result in 60 a lack of comparability with other companies that use different models , methods and assumptions . the black-scholes option pricing model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options that have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable . these characteristics are not present in our option grants . although the black-scholes option pricing model is widely used , existing valuation models , including the black-scholes option pricing model , may not provide reliable measures of the fair values of our stock-based compensation . we recorded charges of $ 5.4 million , $ 4.3 million , and $ 1.4 million in our statements of operations and comprehensive loss for the years ended december 31 , 2015 , 2014 and 2013 , respectively , for stock compensation expense attributable to share-based payments made to employees and directors . research and development prepayments , accruals and related expenses as part of the process of preparing our financial statements , we are required to estimate our accrued and prepaid expenses for research and development activities performed by third parties , including clinical research organizations ( cros ) and clinical investigators . these estimates are made as of the reporting date of the work completed over the life of the individual study in accordance with agreements established with cros and clinical trial sites . some cros invoice us on a monthly basis , while others invoice upon achievement of milestones and the expense is recorded as services are rendered . we determine the estimates of research and development activities incurred at the end of each reporting period through discussion with internal personnel and outside service providers as to the progress or stage of completion of trials or services , as of the end of each reporting period , pursuant to contracts with clinical trial centers and cros and the agreed upon fee to be paid for such services . we periodically confirm the accuracy of our estimates with the service providers and make adjustments if necessary . clinical trial site costs related to patient enrollments are recorded as patients are entered into the trial . story_separator_special_tag development of imo-9200 . companion diagnostic external development expenses . these expenses include external expenses associated with our collaboration with abbott molecular for the development of a companion diagnostic for identification of patients with b-cell lymphoma harboring the myd88 l265p oncogenic mutation incurred since january 2014 when development of the companion diagnostic commenced . we have incurred approximately $ 3.1 million in companion diagnostic external development expenses from january 2014 through december 31 , 2015 , including costs associated with start-up activities , the development of an assay as the prototype of the companion diagnostic , and introduction and use of the assay in our ongoing phase 1/2 clinical trial in patients with dlbcl harboring the myd88 l265p oncogenic mutation . during 2015 , our companion diagnostic external development expenses reflect costs associated with the continued development of the assay and use of the assay in our ongoing phase 1/2 clinical trial in patients with dlbcl harboring the myd88 l265p oncogenic mutation . during 2014 , our companion diagnostic external development expenses reflect costs associated with start-up activities , the development of the assay as the prototype of the companion diagnostic and introduction of the assay for use in our ongoing phase 1/2 clinical trial in patients with dlbcl harboring the myd88 l265p oncogenic mutation . other drug development expenses . these expenses include external expenses associated with preclinical development of identified compounds in anticipation of advancing these compounds into clinical development . in addition , these expenses include internal costs , such as payroll and overhead expenses , associated with 63 preclinical development and products in clinical development . the external expenses associated with preclinical compounds include payments to contract vendors for manufacturing and the related stability studies , preclinical studies , including animal toxicology and pharmacology studies , and professional fees . other drug development expenses also include costs associated with compounds that were previously being developed but are not currently being developed . the increase in other drug development expenses in 2015 , as compared to 2014 , was primarily due to higher consulting costs and additional headcount associated with our expanded drug development programs , and the manufacture of imo-2055 drug supply , which we may use in our immuno-oncology program . the increase in other drug development expenses during 2015 was partially offset by higher costs for preclinical studies and manufacturing activities that were incurred during 2014 to support the ind submission for imo-9200 . the increase in other drug development expenses in 2014 , as compared to 2013 , was primarily due to costs of preclinical studies and manufacturing activities to support the initiation of the phase 1 clinical trial of imo-9200 , increasing payroll costs , including from the addition of a chief medical officer in january 2014 and additional headcount associated with our expanded drug development programs , higher stock-based compensation costs attributable to options granted after the third quarter 2013 and the cost of preclinical studies in our 3ga technology program .

statements as a result of certain factors , including those set forth in the following discussion as well as in part i , item 1a of this annual report on form 10-k. the following discussion provides information and analysis of our results of operations for the three years ended december 31 , 2012 and our liquidity and capital resources . you should read the following discussion in conjunction with part ii , item 8 in this annual report on form 10-k as well as other reports we file with the securities and exchange commission ( “ sec ” ) . overview amkor is one of the world 's leading providers of outsourced semiconductor packaging and test services . packaging and test are integral steps in the process of manufacturing semiconductor devices . the semiconductor manufacturing process begins with the fabrication of individual transistors , or multiple transistors and other electronic elements combined into an integrated circuit ( generally known as a “ chip ” or “ die ” ) , onto semiconductor material such as a silicon wafer . each chip on the wafer is probe tested . the good chips are identified and the wafer is then separated into individual die . each good die is then assembled into a package that typically encapsulates the die for protection and creates the electrical connections used to connect the package to a printed circuit board , module or other part of the electronic device . in some packages , chips are attached to a substrate or leadframe carrier through wirebonding or flip chip interconnects and then encased in a protective material . or , for a wafer-level package , the electrical interconnections are created directly on the surface of the die ( while the wafer is still intact ) so that the chip may be attached directly to other parts of an electronic device without a substrate or leadframe . the packages are then tested using sophisticated equipment to ensure that each packaged chip meets its design and performance specifications . the test services we offer include probe testing and final testing . our packaging services are designed to meet application and chip specific requirements including the type of interconnect technology employed ; size ; thickness and electrical , mechanical and thermal performance . we are able to provide turnkey packaging and test services including semiconductor wafer bump , wafer probe , wafer backgrind , package design , packaging , test and drop shipment services . our customers include , among others : altera corporation ; analog devices , inc. ; broadcom corporation ; intel corporation ; lsi corporation ; qualcomm incorporated ; sony corporation ; stmicroelectronics n.v. ; texas instruments incorporated and toshiba corporation . the outsourced semiconductor packaging and test market is very competitive . we also compete with the internal semiconductor packaging and test capabilities of many of our customers . our business is impacted by market conditions in the semiconductor industry , which is cyclical by nature and impacted by broad economic factors , such as world-wide gross domestic product and consumer spending . historical trends indicate there has been a strong correlation between world-wide gross domestic product levels , consumer spending and semiconductor industry cycles . the semiconductor industry has experienced significant and sometimes prolonged cyclical downturns in the past . we can not predict the timing , strength or duration of any economic slowdown or subsequent economic recovery . story_separator_special_tag packaging net sales in 2011 decreased compared to 2010. the decrease in packaging net sales was primarily driven by weakness in sales of our ball grid array and leadframe packaging solutions partially offset by strong sales of our chip scale packaging solutions supporting mobile communications products . packaging unit volume decreased 1.7 billion units in 2011 to 8.1 billion units , compared to 9.8 billion units in 2010 , primarily attributable to decreased demand for our leadframe packaging solutions . test net sales . test net sales in 2012 increased compared to 2011 due to strong demand for mobile communications products , such as smartphones and tablets . test net sales in 2011 decreased compared to 2010 primarily as a result of decreased demand from the computing and consumer end markets partially offset by increased test services for mobile communications products . 39 cost of sales replace_table_token_8_th our cost of sales consists principally of materials , labor , depreciation and manufacturing overhead . since a substantial portion of the costs at our factories is fixed , relatively modest increases or decreases in capacity utilization rates can have a significant effect on our gross margin . material costs as a percentage of net sales decreased to 43.2 % in 2012 from 44.1 % in 2011 as a result of higher test net sales , which consume few materials , and a shift to a mix of packaging services with a lower material content as a percentage of net sales . material costs in absolute dollars primarily decreased in 2012 due to the net sales mix described above and lower net sales . material costs as a percentage of net sales increased to 44.1 % in 2011 from 42.6 % in 2010 primarily due to the increased cost of gold that is used in most of our wirebond packaging solutions . material costs in absolute dollars decreased in 2011 as a result of the decline in net sales . as a percentage of net sales , labor costs decreased to 14.3 % in 2012 from 14.6 % in 2011. the decrease in labor costs as a percentage of net sales and in absolute dollars was primarily driven by labor cost savings from restructuring activities at our manufacturing operations in japan in early 2012 and the philippines in 2011. as a percentage of net sales , labor costs increased to 14.6 % in 2011 from 12.7 % in 2010. the increase in labor costs as a percentage of net sales was primarily the result of lower levels of utilization driven by decreased customer demand and the corresponding decrease in net sales . as substantially all of our manufacturing workforce is paid in asian currencies , labor costs were also negatively impacted by the appreciation of certain asian based currencies against the u.s. dollar in 2011 compared to 2010. in addition , labor wage rates increased in 2011 and the year also includes a $ 7.7 million charge for workforce reduction programs at our philippine manufacturing operations compared to a $ 3.7 million workforce reduction charge in 2010. other manufacturing costs as a percentage of net sales increased to 27.1 % in 2012 from 23.6 % in 2011. the increase as a percentage of sales and in absolute dollars was primarily attributable to the estimated $ 50.0 million loss contingency charge resulting from our pending patent license arbitration with tessera and increased depreciation expense from our continued investment in property , plant and equipment . other manufacturing costs as a percentage of net sales increased to 23.6 % in 2011 from 22.1 % in 2010. other manufacturing costs in 2011 increased as a percentage of net sales primarily as a result of lower levels of utilization driven by decreased customer demand and the corresponding decrease in net sales . the increase in other manufacturing costs in absolute dollars in 2011 was primarily attributable to the appreciation of certain asian based currencies against the u.s. dollar and increased depreciation from our continued investments in property , plant and equipment . these costs were partially offset by overhead cost savings from the closure of our singapore manufacturing operations . gross profit replace_table_token_9_th gross profit and gross margin in 2012 decreased compared to 2011. the decrease in gross profit and gross margin was primarily due to weakness in demand for some of our wirebond packaging services and the corresponding lower level of utilization of these manufacturing assets , the estimated $ 50.0 million loss contingency charge resulting from our pending patent license arbitration with tessera and lower net sales due to insourcing by some of our idm customers . these decreases were partially offset by increased net sales of flip chip and wafer level packages as well as increased test net sales supporting mobile communications . 40 gross profit and gross margin in 2011 decreased compared to 2010. the decrease was primarily due to weakness in demand for some of our packaging solutions and the corresponding lower level of utilization of our manufacturing assets . the market migration from wirebond to flip chip products created underutilized wirebond capacity faster than we were able to redeploy these assets , which was one of the primary contributors to our 2011 decrease in utilization . gross margin was also negatively impacted by the appreciation of certain asian based currencies against the u.s. dollar , the increased cost of gold that is used in most of our wirebond packages , increased depreciation expense as a result of our continued investment in property , plant and equipment and charges for workforce reduction programs at our philippine manufacturing operations . replace_table_token_10_th packaging gross profit .
","quarterly results the following table sets forth our unaudited consolidated financial data for the last eight quarters ended december 31 , 2012 . our results of operations have varied and may continue to vary from quarter to quarter and are not necessarily indicative of the results of any future period . we believe that we have included all adjustments , consisting only of normal recurring adjustments necessary for a fair statement of our selected quarterly data . you should read our selected quarterly data in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes , included in part ii , item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k. our net sales , gross profit and operating income are generally lower in the first quarter of the year as compared to the fourth quarter of the preceding year primarily due to the effect of consumer buying patterns in the u.s. , europe and asia . semiconductor companies generally reduce their production during the holidays at the end of december which results in a reduction in demand for packaging and test services during the first two weeks of january . we recorded a charge of $ 30.0 million to cost of sales and $ 4.0 million to interest expense during the three months ended june 30 , 2012 , and an additional charge of $ 20.0 million to cost of sales and $ 2.0 million to interest expense during the three months ended december 31 , 2012 , related to our pending patent license arbitration . the calculation of basic and diluted per share amounts for each quarter is based on the weighted average shares outstanding for that period ; consequently , the sum of the quarters may not necessarily be equal to the full year basic and diluted net income per share .

"should one or more of the risks or uncertainties mentioned below materialize , or should underlying assumptions prove incorrect , actual results may vary materially from those anticipated , estimated or projected . we expressly disclaim any responsibility to update our forward looking statements , whether as a result of new information , future events or otherwise . accordingly , investors should use caution in relying on past forward looking statements , which are based on results and trends at the time they are made , to anticipate future results or trends . along with risks detailed in item 1a and from time to time in the partnership 's filings with the securities and exchange commission , some factors that could cause the partnership 's actual results , performance or achievements to differ materially from those expressed or implied by forward looking statements include but are not limited to the following : · the partnership depends on the real estate markets where its properties are located , primarily in eastern massachusetts , and these markets may be adversely affected by local economic market conditions , which are beyond the partnership 's control . · the partnership is subject to the general economic risks affecting the real estate industry , such as dependence on tenants ' financial condition , the need to enter into new leases or renew leases on terms favorable to tenants in order to generate rental revenues and our ability to collect rents from our tenants . · the partnership is also impacted by changing economic conditions making alternative housing arrangements more or less attractive to the partnership 's tenants , such as the interest rates on single family home mortgages and the availability and purchase price of single family homes in the greater boston metropolitan area . · the partnership is subject to significant expenditures associated with each investment , such as debt service payments , real estate taxes , insurance and maintenance costs , which are generally not reduced when circumstances cause a reduction in revenues from a property . · the partnership is subject to increases in heating and utility costs that may arise as a result of economic and market conditions and fluctuations in seasonal weather conditions . · civil disturbances , earthquakes and other natural disasters may result in uninsured or underinsured losses . · actual or threatened terrorist attacks may adversely affect our ability to generate revenues and the value of our properties . · financing or refinancing of partnership properties may not be available to the extent necessary or desirable , or may not be available on favorable terms . 24 · the partnership properties face competition from similar properties in the same market . this competition may affect the partnership 's ability to attract and retain tenants and may reduce the rents that can be charged . · given the nature of the real estate business , the partnership is subject to potential environmental liabilities . these include environmental contamination in the soil at the partnership 's or neighboring real estate , whether caused by the partnership , previous owners of the subject property or neighbors of the subject property , and the presence of hazardous materials in the partnership 's buildings , such as asbestos , lead , mold and radon gas . management is not aware of any material environmental liabilities at this time . · insurance coverage for and relating to commercial properties is increasingly costly and difficult to obtain . in addition , insurance carriers have excluded certain specific items from standard insurance policies , which have resulted in increased risk exposure for the partnership . these include insurance coverage for acts of terrorism and war , and coverage for mold and other environmental conditions . coverage for these items is either unavailable or prohibitively expensive . · market interest rates could adversely affect market prices for class a partnership units and depositary receipts as well as performance and cash flow . · changes in income tax laws and regulations may affect the income taxable to owners of the partnership . these changes may affect the after‑tax value of future distributions . · the partnership may fail to identify , acquire , construct or develop additional properties ; may develop or acquire properties that do not produce a desired or expected yield on invested capital ; may be unable to sell poorly‑ performing or otherwise undesirable properties quickly ; or may fail to effectively integrate acquisitions of properties or portfolios of properties . · risk associated with the use of debt to fund acquisitions and developments . · competition for acquisitions may result in increased prices for properties . · any weakness identified in the partnership 's internal controls as part of the evaluation being undertaken could have an adverse effect on the partnership 's business . · ongoing compliance with sarbanes‑oxley act of 2002 may require additional personnel or systems changes . the foregoing factors should not be construed as exhaustive or as an admission regarding the adequacy of disclosures made by the partnership prior to the date hereof or the effectiveness of said act . the partnership expressly disclaims any obligation to publicly update or revise any forward‑looking statement , whether as a result of new information , future events or otherwise . since the partnership 's long‑term goals include the acquisition of additional properties , a portion of the proceeds from the refinancing and sale of properties is reserved for this purpose . if available acquisitions do not meet the partnership 's investment criteria , the partnership may purchase additional depositary receipts . the partnership will consider refinancing existing properties if the partnership 's cash reserves are insufficient to repay existing mortgages or if the partnership needs additional funds for future acquisitions . on february 24 , 2019 , harold brown , the owner of 75 % of the outstanding voting securities of newreal inc. , the general partner , of new england realty associates limited partnership passed away . as a result , mr. brown 's estate currently holds voting control over the newreal shares .

approved an extension of the repurchase program from 2015 to 2020 and increased the depositary receipt buy‑back allocation from 1.5 million to 2 million receipts . management believes that the $ 25,000,000 line of credit , net cash flow from operations and cash on hand have put the partnership in position to capitalize on investment opportunities should they reveal themselves in the near future . management will continue to repurchase shares per its trading plan . as always , management continues to weigh investment alternatives of stock repurchase , new property acquisitions and dispositions when considering its cash balances and performance of the portfolio . the stock repurchase program that was initiated in 2007 has purchased 1,365,306 depositary receipts through december 31 , 2018 , or approximately 32 % of the outstanding class a depositary receipts . the partnership has not purchased any depositary receipts in 2018. the partnership has retained the hamilton company ( “ hamilton ” ) to manage and administer the partnership 's and joint ventures ' properties . hamilton is a full‑service real estate management company , which has legal , construction , maintenance , architectural , accounting and administrative departments . the partnership 's properties represent approximately 40 % of the total properties and 45 % of the residential properties managed by hamilton . substantially all of the other properties managed by hamilton are owned , wholly or partially , directly or indirectly , by harold brown . the partnership 's second amended and restated

"as a result of many factors , including those factors set forth in part i , item ia , “ risk factors ” of this annual report on form 10-k , our actual results could differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward-looking statements . overview we are a late-stage clinical company developing targeted fusion protein therapeutics , or tfpts , composed of an anti-cancer antibody fragment tethered to a protein toxin for the treatment of cancer . we genetically fuse the cancer-targeting antibody fragment and the cytotoxic protein payload into a single molecule which is produced through our proprietary one-step manufacturing process . we target tumor cell surface antigens with limited expression on normal cells . binding of the target antigen by the tfpt allows for rapid internalization into the targeted cancer cell . we have designed our targeted proteins to overcome the fundamental efficacy and safety challenges inherent in existing antibody-drug conjugates , or adcs , where a payload is chemically attached to a targeting antibody . our most advanced product candidate vb4-845 , also known as vicinium® , is a locally-administered targeted fusion protein composed of an anti-epcam , or epithelial cell adhesion molecule , antibody fragment tethered to a truncated form of pseudomonas exotoxin a for the treatment of high-risk non-muscle invasive bladder cancer , or nmibc . on january 3 , 2019 , we reported preliminary efficacy data for the primary endpoint of our ongoing single-arm , multi-center , open-label phase 3 clinical trial of vicinium as a monotherapy in patients with high-risk , bacillus calmette-guérin , or bcg , unresponsive nmibc , called the vista trial . the data reported the preliminary complete response rates in evaluable carcinoma in situ , or cis , patients following three , six , nine and 12 months of treatment in the clinical trial . the results were consistent with the results observed in the previously completed phase 1 and phase 2 clinical trials . we expect to report updated 12-month topline efficacy and safety data during the second quarter of 2019. in august 2018 , we received fast track designation from the fda for vicinium for the treatment of high-risk nmibc . in june 2017 , we entered into a cooperative research and development agreement , or crada , with the national cancer institute , or nci , for the development of vicinium in combination with astrazeneca 's immune checkpoint inhibitor , durvalumab , for the treatment of nmibc . under the terms of the crada , the nci will conduct a phase 1 clinical trial in patients with high-risk nmibc to evaluate the safety , efficacy and biological correlates of vicinium in combination with durvalumab . this phase 1 clinical trial is open and is actively recruiting patients . vicinium has also been evaluated for the treatment of squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck , or scchn . vicinium for the treatment of scchn had previously been designated as proxinium to indicate its different fill volume and vial size as well as its different route for local administration via intratumoral injection . in addition to our locally-administered tfpts , our pipeline also includes systemically-administered tfpts in development that are built around our proprietary de-immunized variant of the plant-derived cytotoxin bouganin , or debouganin . we have deferred further development of vicinium for the treatment of scchn and vb6-845d in order to focus our efforts and our resources on our ongoing development of vicinium for the treatment of high-risk nmibc . we are also exploring collaboration agreements for vicinium for the treatment of scchn and vb6-845d . we were incorporated and commenced active operations in early 2008 , and our operations to date have been limited to organizing and staffing our company , acquiring rights to intellectual property , business planning , raising capital , developing our technology , identifying potential product candidates , undertaking pre-clinical studies and conducting clinical trials . to date , we have financed our operations primarily through private placements of our common stock and preferred stock and convertible bridge notes , venture debt borrowings , our ipo , and secondary offerings , sales effected in an “ at-the-market ” facility through our agent , cowen and company , llc , or cowen , from the license agreement with roche , and , to a lesser extent , from our former collaboration agreement with thrombogenics n.v. , or thrombogenics . we have devoted substantially all of our 103 financial resources and efforts to research and development activities . we have not completed development of any of our product candidates . we expect to continue to incur significant expenses and operating losses over the next several years . our net losses may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter and year to year . we maintain global development , marketing and commercialization rights for all of our tfpt-based product candidates . upon regulatory approval for our product candidates , we will explore various commercialization strategies to market our products . if we obtain regulatory approval for vicinium for the treatment of high-risk nmibc , we may build a north american specialty urology sales force to market the product or seek commercialization partners . if we obtain regulatory approval for our other product candidates , including or for vicinium in other oncology indications , we may seek partners with oncology expertise in order to maximize the commercial value of each asset or a portfolio of assets . we also own or exclusively license worldwide intellectual property rights for all of our tfpt-based product candidates , covering our key patents with protection ranging from 2018 to 2036. license agreement with roche on june 10 , 2016 , we entered into the license agreement with roche . under the license agreement , we granted roche an exclusive , worldwide license to develop and commercialize , our monoclonal antibody ebi-031 and all other il-6 antagonist antibody technology owned by us , and pursuing ongoing patent prosecution , at its cost . story_separator_special_tag our future capital requirements will depend on many factors , including : the scope , initiation , progress , timing , costs and results of pre-clinical development and laboratory testing and clinical trials for our product candidates ; our ability to establish collaborations on favorable terms , if at all , particularly manufacturing , marketing and distribution arrangements for our product candidates ; the costs and timing of the implementation of commercial-scale manufacturing activities , including those associated with the manufacturing process and technology transfer to third party manufacturers to facilitate such commercial-scale manufacturing ; the costs and timing of establishing sales , marketing and distribution capabilities for our product candidates for which we may receive regulatory approval ; the costs and timing of preparing , filing and prosecuting patent applications , maintaining and enforcing our intellectual property rights and defending any intellectual property-related claims ; our obligation to make milestone , royalty and other payments to third-party licensors under our licensing agreements ; the extent to which we in-license or acquire rights to other products , product candidates or technologies ; the outcome , timing and cost of regulatory review by the fda and comparable foreign regulatory authorities , including the potential for the fda or comparable foreign regulatory authorities , including health canada , to require that we perform more studies or clinical trials than those that we currently expect ; our ability to achieve certain future regulatory , development and commercialization milestones under the license agreement with roche ; the effect of competing technological and market developments ; and the revenue , if any , received from commercial sales of any product candidates for which we receive regulatory approval . accordingly , until such time that we can generate substantial revenue from product sales , if ever , we expect to finance our operations through public or private equity or debt financings or other sources . however , we may be unable to raise additional funds or enter into such arrangements when needed on favorable terms , or at all , which would have a negative impact on our financial condition and could force us to delay , limit , reduce or terminate our development programs or commercialization efforts or grant to others rights to develop or market product candidates that we would otherwise prefer to develop and market ourselves . failure to receive additional funding could cause us to cease operations , in part or in full . furthermore , even if we believe we have sufficient funds for our current or future operating plans , we may seek additional capital due to favorable market conditions or strategic considerations . we believe that our cash and cash equivalents of $ 50.4 million as of december 31 , 2018 will be sufficient to fund our current operating plan into 2020 ; however , we have based this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong , and our capital resources may be utilized faster than we currently expect . financial operations overview revenue to date , we have not generated any revenues from the sale of products . substantially all of our revenue to date has been derived from the license agreement with roche and , to a lesser extent , from our former collaboration with thrombogenics . we do not 105 expect to generate significant product revenue unless and until we obtain marketing approval for , and commercialize our product candidates . under the terms of the license agreement with roche , roche paid an upfront license fee of $ 7.5 million and a development milestone payment of $ 22.5 million as a result of the ind application for ebi-031 becoming effective.we are also entitled to receive up to an additional $ 240.0 million upon the achievement of other specified regulatory , development and commercial milestones , as well as royalties based on net sales of potential future products containing ebi-031 or any other potential future products containing other il-6 compounds . the next licensing milestone payment expected from roche , if any , will be triggered upon commencement of a phase 2 clinical trial . under the collaboration and license agreement with thrombogenics , which we entered into in may 2013 , we and thrombogenics collaborated to seek to identify protein or peptide therapeutics that directly modulate any of a specified set of targets in a novel pathway in retinal disease . in connection with the agreement , thrombogenics paid us an upfront technology licensing fee of $ 1.75 million and paid us to perform activities under the agreement at a set rate per full-time equivalent person working on collaboration activities . on august 1 , 2016 , we received notice from thrombogenics of thrombogenics 's termination , effective as of october 31 , 2016 , of the agreement . research and development expenses research and development expenses consist primarily of costs incurred for the development of our product candidates , which include : employee-related expenses , including salaries , benefits , travel and stock-based compensation expense ; expenses incurred under agreements with cros , and investigative sites that conduct our clinical trials ; expenses associated with developing manufacturing capabilities and manufacturing clinical study materials ; facilities , depreciation , and other expenses , which include direct and allocated expenses for rent and maintenance of facilities , insurance , and other supplies ; and expenses associated with pre-clinical and regulatory activities . we expense research and development costs as incurred . we recognize external development costs based on an evaluation of the progress to completion of specific tasks using information and data provided to us by our vendors and our clinical sites . the successful development and commercialization of any product candidate is highly uncertain .
","results of operations comparison of the years ended december 31 , 2018 and 2017 111 replace_table_token_14_th revenue . revenue was $ 0.0 million for the year ended december 31 , 2018 compared to $ 0.4 million for the year ended december 31 , 2017 . the decrease was due to a decrease in license revenue we recognized in 2017 pursuant to the license agreement with roche . research and development expenses . research and development expenses were $ 14.1 million for the year ended december 31 , 2018 compared to $ 12.5 million for the year ended december 31 , 2017 . the increase of $ 1.6 million was due primarily to increases in tech transfer and commercial manufacturing costs of $ 2.5 million and $ 0.6 million higher consulting fees in support of the vista trial . these increases were partially offset by decreases in vicinium cro-related development expenses of $ 1.3 million and a reduction in materials/lab supplies of $ 0.2 million as internal manufacturing costs were replaced by external technology transfer costs . general and administrative expenses . general and administrative expenses were $ 11.6 million for the year ended december 31 , 2018 compared to $ 8.1 million for the year ended december 31 , 2017 . the increase of $ 3.6 million was due primarily to an increase of professional and legal fees of $ 1.8 million as well as severance and relocation costs of $ 0.9 million related to our ceo transition . in addition , the company increased commercial market research costs by $ 0.6 million for the year ended december 31 , 2018. loss from change in fair value of contingent consideration . the change in loss in fair value of contingent consideration was $ 0.3 million for the year ended december 31 , 2018 compared to the year ended december 31 , 2017 .

potential volatility of energy prices , rapid technological change , competition , market acceptance of our products and our ability to achieve our sales plans and cost reduction targets , as well as other risks set forth in our filings with the securities and exchange commission including those set forth under item 1a — risk factors in this report . overview and recent developments overview we are a leading integrated fuel cell company with a growing global presence . we design , manufacture , install , operate and service ultra-clean , efficient and reliable stationary fuel cell power plants . our power plants offer scalable on-site power and utility grid support , helping customers solve their energy , environmental and business challenges . global urban populations are expanding , becoming more industrialized and requiring greater amounts of power to sustain their growth . as policymakers and power producers struggle to find economical and readily available solutions that will alleviate the impact of harmful pollutants and emissions while improving the resiliency of the electric grid , the market for ultra-clean , efficient and reliable distributed generation is rapidly growing . with fully commercialized ultra-clean fuel cell power plants and decades of experience in the industry , we are well positioned to grow our installed base of power plants . our plants are operating in more than 50 locations worldwide and have generated more than two billion kilowatt hours ( kwh ) of electricity , which is equivalent to powering more than 181,000 average size u.s. homes for one year . our installed base and growing backlog exceeds 300 megawatts ( mw ) . our diverse and growing customer base includes major utility companies , municipalities , universities , government entities and businesses in a variety of commercial and industrial enterprises . our leading geographic markets are south korea and the united states and we are actively pursuing expanding opportunities in asia , europe and canada . we service the power plants for virtually every customer we have globally under service agreements . we monitor and operate the power plants around the clock from our technical assistance center located at our danbury , connecticut headquarters . we have an extensive service network of fuelcell energy technicians who provide on-site service and maintenance . recent developments market update the company has a strong sales pipeline in both north america and europe totaling over 310 mw as of october 31 , 2013 valued at over $ 1.2 billion . significant project development activities occurred in fiscal 2013 and we recently received regulatory approvals on several projects . as a result , we anticipate closing over 30 mw of new orders in the northeast and california in the first half of 2014. production levels , the company 's order closure expectations and the need to be able to execute on multi-plant projects quickly , are coordinated closely . in addition to our existing pipeline , we are actively developing opportunities directly and through our business partners . multiple utilities in four u.s. states have recently issued over one gigawatt of renewable power requests for proposals ( rfp 's ) that all include fuel cells . the company is actively bidding these solicitations . utility-scale adoption is accelerating in south korea with recent announcements by our partner posco energy including a 20 megawatt and a 40 megawatt project . posco energy 's total order pipeline exceeded 300 mw as of october 31 , 2013. these recent actions in north america and asia illustrate both the market potential as well as the growing awareness of the value of clean distributed generation . in september 2013 , we announced a teaming and co-marketing agreement with nrg energy , the largest independent power producer in north america . this agreement leverages our resources and we believe it will lead to meaningful order flow . the agreement includes a power purchase agreement model for customers that prefer a pay-as-you-go option whereby nrg energy 42 will own the power plant and sell the ultra-clean power and high quality heat to the customer . the agreement adds an important new sales channel for the marketing and sale of fuelcell energy power plants . nrg will market the power plants to its customer base and fuelcell energy is expected to install , operate and maintain each power plant . operations update the company began 2013 with north american production levels at an annual run-rate of 56 mw . the production rate was increased to 70 mw during the year and the company expanded total capacity by about 11 percent through process improvements to 100 mw annually . the company maintained an annual production run-rate at the torrington , connecticut production facility of approximately 70 mw during the fourth quarter of 2013 , producing 17.5 mw of cell components for fuel cell kits and fuel cell power plants . story_separator_special_tag cost of product sales includes costs to design , engineer , manufacture and ship our power plants and power plant components to customers , site engineering and construction costs where we are responsible for power plant system installation , costs for scheduled module replacements assembly and conditioning equipment sold to posco energy , warranty expense , liquidated damages and inventory excess and obsolescence charges . cost of service agreements include maintenance and stack replacement costs to service power plants for customers with service agreements and operating costs for our units under ppa 's . we contract with a concentrated number of customers for the sale of our products and for research and development contracts . refer to note 1 of notes to consolidated financial statements for more information on customer concentrations . advanced technologies contracts advanced technologies contracts revenue and related costs for years ended october 31 , 2013 and 2012 were as follows : replace_table_token_8_th advanced technologies contracts revenue for the fiscal year ended october 31 , 2013 was $ 14.4 million , which increased $ 7.0 million when compared to $ 7.5 million of revenue for the fiscal year ended october 31 , 2012. the increase was primarily related 46 to solid oxide fuel cell development programs , particularly the unmanned aerial program with boeing which was included in advanced technologies contract revenues as a result of the december 2013 acquisition of versa . cost of advanced technologies contracts increased $ 6.6 million to $ 13.9 million for the fiscal year ended october 31 , 2013 , compared to $ 7.2 million for the same period in the prior year . gross profit from advanced technologies contracts for the fiscal year ended october 31 , 2013 was $ 0.6 million compared to $ 0.2 million for the fiscal year ended october 31 , 2012. administrative and selling expenses administrative and selling expenses were $ 21.2 million for the fiscal year ended october 31 , 2013 compared to $ 18.2 million during the fiscal year ended october 31 , 2012. administrative and selling expenses increased as a result of expenditures to develop and expand the european market for megawatt-class fuel cell power plants and to continue efforts to commercialize solid oxide fuel cell technology . research and development expenses research and development expenses increased $ 1.3 million to $ 15.7 million during the fiscal year ended october 31 , 2013 , compared to $ 14.4 million during fiscal year 2012. the increase is a result of the consolidation of versa 's results with the results of the company beginning in fiscal year 2013 combined with initiatives to continue to reduce the cost profile of large scale multi-megawatt installations through consolidating certain aspects of the balance of plant functions . our internal research and development continues to be focused on cost reduction opportunities and product enhancements that have near term product implementation potential . loss from operations loss from operations for the fiscal year ended october 31 , 2013 was $ 29.8 million compared to a loss of $ 32.1 million in 2012. the change year-over-year is a result of favorable gross profit from product sales offset by the impact of increased business development activity in the north american and european markets and increased research and development costs associated with consolidating versa . interest expense interest expense for the fiscal years ended october 31 , 2013 and 2012 was $ 4.0 million and $ 2.3 million , respectively . interest expense increased primarily as a result of interest expense associated with the 8.0 % unsecured convertible debt issued in june 2013. interest expense for both periods also includes interest for the amortization of the redeemable preferred stock of a subsidiary discount of $ 2.0 million . income/ ( loss ) from equity investments income of $ 0.05 million from equity investments recorded in fiscal year ended october 31 , 2013 represents our share of versa 's income through the acquisition date . a loss of $ 0.6 million was recorded for our share of versa 's losses for the fiscal year ended october 31 , 2012. license fee and royalty income license fee income for the fiscal year ended october 31 , 2012 was $ 1.6 million which represents the license fee and royalty income earned from posco energy . beginning in fiscal year 2013 , license fees and royalty income have been included within revenues under service agreements and license revenues . refer to critical accounting policies and estimates for further discussion on this change . impairment of equity investment an impairment charge was recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal year ended october 31 , 2012 as an adjustment to the carrying value of the investment in versa to its estimated fair value . other income ( expense ) , net other income ( expense ) , net , was expense of $ 1.2 million for the fiscal year ended october 31 , 2013 compared to other income of $ 1.2 million for the same period in 2012. the current period expense recorded is primarily associated with the non-cash fair value adjustment of certain embedded derivatives and the prior year income recorded primarily represents proceeds received relating to an insurance recovery from a prior year claim and income received from scrap sales . provision for income taxes 47 we have not paid federal or state income taxes in several years due to our history of net operating losses ( nol ) , although we have paid foreign taxes in south korea . for the fiscal year ended october 31 , 2013 our provision for income taxes was $ 0.4 million . we have begun manufacturing products that are gross margin profitable on a per unit basis ; however , we can not estimate when production volumes will be sufficient to generate taxable domestic income . accordingly , no tax benefit has been recognized for these net operating losses or other deferred tax assets as significant uncertainty exists surrounding the recoverability of these deferred tax assets .

however , the unprecedented disruption of the global economy due to the covid-19 pandemic has impacted all businesses . our government business , which represents approximately 60 % of our revenue , has been stable , while our commercial business experienced relatively more impact . much of our commercial business has continued due to regulatory drivers , but we have seen project delays in the industrial sectors . our diversified end-markets have allowed us to redeploy staff to areas of uninterrupted or increased demand , and we have made decisions to align our cost structures with our clients ' projects . the actions we have taken to navigate through this worldwide pandemic , the strength of our balance sheet , and our technical leadership position us well to address the global challenges of providing clean water , environmental restoration , and the impacts of climate change . in fiscal 2020 , o ur revenue decreased 3.6 % compared to fiscal 2019. our year-over-year revenue comparisons were impacted by the disposal of our canadian turn-key pipeline activities in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019 and a decrease in revenue from disaster response activities related to california wildfires . excluding the disposal and the decreased california wildfire activity , our revenue increased 3.5 % in fiscal 2020 compared to last year . this increase includes $ 210.5 million of revenue from acquisitions , which did not have comparable revenue in fiscal 2019. excluding the net impact of acquisitions/disposals and the california wildfire disaster response activities , our revenue in fiscal 2020 decreased 3.9 % compared to fiscal 2019 primarily due to the adverse impact of the covid-19 pandemic on our u.s. commercial and international revenue . u.s. federal government . our u.s. federal government revenue increased 5.6 % in fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019. excluding contributions from acquisitions , our revenue declined 1.5 % in fiscal 2020 compared to last year . the decrease was primarily due to reduced international development activities , partially offset by increased federal information technology consulting activity . during periods of economic volatility , our u.s. federal government business has historically been the most stable and predictable . we expect our u.s. federal government revenue to grow modestly in fiscal 2021 due to continued increased federal information technology consulting activity . however , u.s. federal spending amounts and priorities could change significantly from our current expectations , which could have a significant positive or negative impact on our fiscal 2021 revenue . u.s. state and local government . our u.s. state and local government revenue decreased 25.3 % in fiscal 2020 compared to last year as we experienced a decrease in revenue from the aforementioned california wildfire disaster response activities . this decline was partially offset by continued broad-based growth in our u.s. state and local government project-related infrastructure business , particularly with increased revenue from municipal water infrastructure work in the metropolitan areas of california , texas , and florida . most of our work for u.s. state and local governments relates to critical water and environmental programs , which we expect to increase further next year . however , further budgetary constraints to our clients could negatively impact our business . conversely , increased disaster response activity could cause our fiscal 2021 revenue to exceed our current expectations . u.s. commercial . our u.s. commercial revenue decreased 6.2 % in fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019. this decline was primarily due to reduced industrial activity as a result of the covid-19 pandemic . we currently expect the adverse impact of the covid-19 pandemic to our u.s. commercial revenue to continue to be more significant than to our u.s. government programs and projects throughout most of next year . international . our international revenue increased 3.2 % in fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019. excluding the impact of the aforementioned prior-year disposal of our canadian turn-key pipeline activities , our international revenue increased 11.4 % in fiscal 2020 compared to last year . this increase includes $ 132.5 million of revenue from acquisitions , which did not have comparable revenue in fiscal 2019. excluding the net impact of acquisitions/disposals , our international revenue in fiscal 37 2020 decreased 5.5 % compared to last year . the revenue decline primarily reflects the adverse impact of the covid-19 pandemic , partially offset by increased renewable energy activity in canada . in light of the covid-19 pandemic , we currently expect our overall international government work to be stable in fiscal 2021 ; however , our international commercial activities could have a significant adverse impact if the current economic conditions due to covid-19 are prolonged . results of operations fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019 consolidated results of operations replace_table_token_8_th ( 1 ) we believe that the presentation of `` revenue , net of subcontractor costs '' , which is a non-u.s. gaap financial measure , enhances investors ' ability to analyze our business trends and performance because it substantially measures the work performed by our employees . story_separator_special_tag further , our operating income reflects non-cash goodwill impairment charges of $ 15.8 million and $ 7.8 million in fiscal 2020 and 2019 , respectively . these charges are described below under `` fiscal 2020 and 2019 impairment of goodwill . '' excluding these items , our adjusted operating income increased $ 2.7 million , or 1.1 % , in fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019. the increase reflects improved results in our cig segment partially offset by lower operating income in our gsg segment . gsg and cig results are described below under `` government services group '' and `` commercial/international services group '' , respectively . our net interest expense was $ 13.1 million in fiscal 2020 compared to $ 13.6 million last year . the decrease primarily reflects lower interest rates ( primarily libor ) , and to a lesser extent , lower average borrowings . the effective tax rates for fiscal 2020 and 2019 were 23.7 % and 9.3 % , respectively . the goodwill impairment charges in fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2019 and certain of the transaction charges in fiscal 2019 did not have related tax benefits , which increased our effective tax rates by 1.5 % and 1.1 % in fiscal 2020 and 2019 , respectively . conversely , income tax expense was reduced by $ 8.3 million and $ 6.4 million of excess tax benefits on share-based payments in fiscal 2020 and 2019 , respectively . additionally , we finalized the analysis of our deferred tax liabilities for the tax cuts and jobs act 's ( `` tcja 's '' ) lower tax rates in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 and recorded a deferred tax benefit of $ 2.6 million . also , valuation allowances of $ 22.3 million in australia were released due to sufficient positive evidence obtained during the second quarter of fiscal 2019. the valuation allowances were primarily related to net operating loss and research and development credit carryforwards and other temporary differences . we evaluated the positive evidence against any negative evidence and determined that it was more likely than not that the deferred tax assets would be realized . the factors used to assess the likelihood of realization were the past performance of the related entities , our forecast of future taxable income , and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize the deferred tax assets . excluding the impact of the non-deductible goodwill impairment charges and transaction costs , the excess tax benefits on share-based payments , the net deferred tax benefits from the tcja , and the valuation allowance release , our effective tax rates in fiscal 2020 and 2019 were 25.6 % and 24.6 % , respectively . our eps was $ 3.16 in fiscal 2020 , compared to $ 2.84 in fiscal 2019. on the same basis as our adjusted operating income and excluding non-recurring tax benefits in fiscal 2019 , eps was $ 3.26 in fiscal 2020 , compared to $ 3.17 last year . segment results of operations government services group ( `` gsg '' ) replace_table_token_10_th revenue and revenue , net of subcontractor costs , decreased $ 41.7 million , or 2.3 % , and $ 29.3 million , or 2.2 % , respectively , in fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019. these declines primarily reflect the previously described decrease in revenue from disaster response activities related to california wildfires offset by revenue from acquisitions , which did not have comparable revenue in fiscal 2019. excluding the contributions from acquisitions and the california wildfire disaster response activities , our revenue in fiscal 2020 was substantially the same as fiscal 2019 as increases in federal information technology activity were offset by lower international development revenue . operating income decreased $ 16.6 million in fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019 primarily reflecting the lower disaster response revenue . also , we incurred $ 1.6 million of incremental costs for actions to respond to the covid-19 pandemic in the second quarter of fiscal 2020. our operating margin , based on revenue , net of subcontractor costs , was 13.0 % in fiscal 2020 compared to 13.9 % last year . excluding the covid-19 charges , our operating margin was 13.1 % in fiscal 2020 . 40 commercial/international services group ( `` cig '' ) replace_table_token_11_th revenue and revenue , net of subcontractor costs , decreased $ 76.5 million , or 5.7 % , and $ 14.5 million , or 1.4 % , respectively , in fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019. our year-over-year revenue comparisons were impacted by the disposal of our canadian turn-key pipeline activities in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019 , and a reduction in revenue and a corresponding charge to operating income of $ 13.7 million in fiscal 2019 for a remediation project where the work was substantially performed in prior years . excluding the disposal and t he fiscal 2019 claim resolution , our revenue decreased 2.2 % due to lower subcontractor activity and the adverse impact of the covid-19 pandemic on our u.s. and international commercial revenue . operating income increased $ 34.4 million in fiscal 2020 compared to last year . this comparison was also impacted by the disposal of our canadian turn-key pipeline activities . our fiscal 2020 operating income includes gains of $ 8.5 million from the disposition of non-core equipment and our fiscal 2019 operating income includes charges of $ 10.9 million related to these activities . in addition , we incurred $ 6.6 million of incremental costs for actions to respond to the covid-19 pandemic in the second quarter of fiscal 2020. excluding the canadian turn-key pipeline activities , the covid-19 charges , and the aforementioned $ 13.7 million claim in fiscal 2019 , our operating income increased $ 7.9 million , or 7.5 % , in fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019. on the same basis , our operating margin , based on revenue , net of subcontractor costs , improved to 10.7 % in fiscal 2020 from 9.7 % last year .
","consolidated results of operations replace_table_token_13_th ( 1 ) we believe that the presentation of `` revenue , net of subcontractor costs '' , which is a non-u.s. gaap financial measure , enhances investors ' ability to analyze our business trends and performance because it substantially measures the work performed by our employees . in the course of providing services , we routinely subcontract various services and , under certain usaid programs , issue grants . generally , these subcontractor costs and grants are passed through to our clients and , in accordance with u.s. gaap and industry practice , are included in our revenue when it is our contractual responsibility to procure or manage these activities . because subcontractor services can vary significantly from project to project and period to period , changes in revenue may not necessarily be indicative of our business trends . accordingly , we segregate subcontractor costs from revenue to promote a better understanding of our business by evaluating revenue exclusive of costs associated with external service providers . nm = not meaningful 43 the following table reconciles our reported results to non-u.s. gaap adjusted results , which exclude rcm results and certain non-operating accounting-related adjustments , such as acquisition and integration costs , gains/losses from adjustments to contingent consideration , and non-recurring tax benefits . adjusted results also exclude charges from the disposal of our canadian turn-key pipeline activities in fiscal 2019 and losses from the divestitures of our non-core utility field services operations and other non-core assets in fiscal 2018. the disposal in fiscal 2019 also resulted in a $ 7.8 million goodwill impairment charge that is excluded from our adjusted results . our fiscal 2019 adjusted results exclude a reduction of revenue and a corresponding charge to operating income of $ 13.7 million from a claim that was resolved in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019 for a remediation project , where the work was substantially performed in prior years .

"f-8 saul centers , inc. notes to consolidated financial statements 1. organization , basis of presentation saul centers , inc. ( “ saul centers ” ) was incorporated under the maryland general corporation law on june 10 , 1993. saul centers operates as a real estate investment trust ( a “ reit ” ) under the internal revenue code of 1986 , as amended ( the “ code ” ) . the company is required to annually distribute at least 90 % of its reit taxable income ( excluding net capital gains ) to its stockholders and meet certain organizational and other requirements . saul centers has made and intends to continue to make regular quarterly distributions to story_separator_special_tag management 's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ( md & a ) begins with the company 's primary business strategy to give the reader an overview of the goals of the company 's business . this is followed by a discussion of the critical accounting policies that the company believes are important to understanding the assumptions and judgments incorporated in the company 's reported financial results . the next section discusses the company 's results of operations for the past two years . beginning on page 49 , the company provides an analysis of its liquidity and capital resources , including discussions of its cash flows , debt arrangements , sources of capital and financial commitments . finally , on page 54 , the company discusses funds from operations , or ffo , which is a non-gaap financial measure of performance of an equity reit used by the reit industry . the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with `` item 6. selected financial data , '' and the consolidated financial statements and related footnotes included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k. we make statements in this section that are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws . for a complete discussion of forward-looking statements , see the section in this report entitled `` forward-looking statements . '' certain risks may cause our actual results , performance or achievements to differ materially from those expressed or implied by the following discussion . for a discussion of such risk factors , see `` item 1a . risk factors . '' 38 impact of covid-19 on march 11 , 2020 , the world health organization declared a novel strain of coronavirus ( `` covid-19 '' ) a pandemic , and on march 13 , 2020 , the united states declared a national emergency with respect to covid-19 . as a result , the covid-19 pandemic is negatively affecting almost every industry directly or indirectly . the actions taken by federal , state and local governments to mitigate the spread of covid-19 by ordering closure of nonessential businesses and ordering residents to generally stay at home , and subsequent phased re-openings , have resulted in many of our tenants announcing mandated or temporary closures of their operations and or requesting adjustments to their lease terms . experts predict that the covid-19 pandemic will trigger a period of global economic slowdown or a global recession . covid-19 could have a material and adverse effect on or cause disruption to our business or financial condition , results from operations , cash flows and the market value and trading price of our securities . if the effects of covid-19 result in continued deterioration of economic and market conditions , or if the company 's expected holding period for assets changes , subsequent tests for impairment could result in impairment charges in the future . the company can provide no assurance that material impairment charges with respect to the company 's investment properties will not occur in 2021 or future periods . as of december 31 , 2020 , we have not identified any impairment triggering events , including the impact of covid-19 and corresponding tenant requests for rent relief . therefore , under applicable gaap guidance , no impairment charges have been recorded . however , we have yet to see the long-term effects of covid-19 and the extent to which it may impact our tenants in the future . indications of a tenant 's inability to continue as a going concern , changes in our view or strategy relative to a tenant 's business or industry as a result of covid-19 , or changes in our long-term hold strategies , could be indicative of an impairment triggering event . accordingly , the company will continue to monitor circumstances and events in future periods to determine whether impairment charges are warranted . while the company 's grocery store , pharmacy , bank and home improvement store tenants generally remain open , restaurants are operating with limited indoor seating , supplemented with delivery and curbside pick-up , and most health , beauty supply and services , fitness centers , and other non-essential businesses are re-opening with limited customer capacity depending on location . as of february 23 , 2021 , payments by tenants of contractual base rent and operating expense and real estate tax recoveries totaled approximately 94 % , and 92 % for the fourth quarter of 2020 and january 2021 , respectively . the company is generally not charging late fees or delinquent interest on past due payments and , in many cases , rent deferral agreements have been negotiated to allow tenants temporary relief where needed . the deferral agreements , generally , permit tenants to defer 30 to 90 days of rent , operating expense and real estate tax recovery payments until a later time in their lease term with repayment typically occurring over a 12-month period generally commencing in 2021. we expect that our rent collections will continue to be below our tenants ' contractual rent obligations for so long as governmental orders require non-essential businesses to remain at limited capacity or closed and residents to stay at home . we will continue to accrue rental revenue during the deferral period . story_separator_special_tag the residential component of the waycroft , a project with 491 apartment units and 60,000 square feet of retail space , on north glebe road , within two blocks of the ballston metro station , in arlington , virginia was placed into service in april 2020. the company also has a development pipeline of zoned sites , either in its portfolio ( some of which are currently shopping center operating properties ) or under contract , for development of up to 3,700 apartment units and 975,000 square feet of retail and office space . all such sites are located adjacent to red line metro stations in montgomery county , maryland . the company intends to selectively add free-standing pad site buildings within its shopping center portfolio , and replace underperforming tenants with tenants that generate strong traffic , generally anchor stores such as supermarkets , drug stores and fitness centers , as evidenced by the march 2020 addition of a 69,000 square foot giant food at seven corners , the june 2020 addition of a 36,000 square foot la fitness at broadlands village and the august 2020 addition of a 54,000 square foot 99 ranch grocery store at shops at fairfax . the company has seven new pad site tenants , including three at our newly developed ashbrook marketplace shopping center , that began paying rent in 2020. annualized rent from these seven pad sites totals approximately $ 1.1 million . additionally , the company has executed leases or leases are under negotiation for 10 more pad sites , tenants at five of which are expected to begin paying rent in 2021. the annualized rent from these 10 pad sites totals approximately $ 1.6 million . 41 in recent years , there has been a limited amount of quality properties for sale and pricing of those properties has escalated . accordingly , management believes acquisition opportunities for investment in existing and new shopping center and mixed-use properties in the near future is uncertain . nevertheless , because of the company 's conservative capital structure , including its cash and capacity under its revolving credit facility , management believes that the company is positioned to take advantage of additional investment opportunities as attractive properties are identified and market conditions improve . ( see “ item 1. business - capital policies ” . ) it is management 's view that several of the sub-markets in which the company operates have , or are expected to have in the future , attractive supply/demand characteristics . the company will continue to evaluate acquisition , development and redevelopment as integral parts of its overall business plan . prior to the covid-19 pandemic , economic conditions within the local washington , dc metropolitan area had remained relatively stable . issues facing the federal government relating to taxation , spending and interest rate policy will likely continue to impact the office , retail and residential real estate markets over the coming years . because the majority of the company 's property operating income is produced by our shopping centers , we continually monitor the implications of government policy changes , as well as shifts in consumer demand between on-line and in-store shopping , on future shopping center construction and retailer store expansion plans . based on our observations , we continue to adapt our marketing and merchandising strategies in ways to maximize our future performance . the company 's commercial leasing percentage , on a same property basis , which excludes the impact of properties not in operation for the entirety of the comparable periods , decreased to 92.4 % at december 31 , 2020 , from 95.1 % at december 31 , 2019. we expect the volume of lease renewals in 2021 , and the rental rates at which leases renew , will be negatively impacted by the effects of covid-19 when comparing executed retail leases to prior year leasing activity . the company maintains a ratio of total debt to total asset value of under 50 % , which allows the company to obtain additional secured borrowings if necessary . as of december 31 , 2020 , amortizing fixed-rate mortgage debt with staggered maturities from 2021 to 2035 represented approximately 84.5 % of the company 's notes payable , thus minimizing refinancing risk . the company 's variable-rate debt consists of $ 179.5 million outstanding under the credit facility . as of december 31 , 2020 , the company has availability of approximately $ 220.3 million under its $ 325.0 million unsecured revolving credit facility . although it is management 's present intention to concentrate future acquisition and development activities on transit-centric , primarily residential mixed-use properties in the washington , d.c./baltimore metropolitan area , the company may , in the future , also acquire other types of real estate in other areas of the country as opportunities present themselves . the company plans to continue to diversify in terms of property types , locations , size and market , and it does not set any limit on the amount or percentage of assets that may be invested in any one property or any one geographic area . the following table sets forth average annualized base rent per square foot and average annualized effective rent per square foot for the company 's commercial properties ( all properties except for the waycroft , clarendon center and park van ness apartments ) . for purposes of this table , annualized effective rent is annualized base rent minus amortized tenant improvements and amortized leasing commissions . the $ 0.06 per square foot increase in base rent in the 2020 period compared to the 2019 period is primarily attributable to a rate increase in commercial leases relating to completed development projects . replace_table_token_11_th critical accounting policies the company 's consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states ( “ gaap ” ) , which requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reporting of financial position and results of operations .
","results of operations the following is a discussion of the components of revenue and expense for the entire company . this section generally discusses 2020 and 2019 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2020 and 2019. discussions of 2018 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2019 and 2018 that are not included in this form 10-k can be found in “ management 's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ” part ii , item 7 of our annual report on form 10-k for the fiscal year ended december 31 , 2019 filed on february 27 , 2020. replace_table_token_12_th base rent includes $ 1.3 million and $ ( 1.4 ) million , for the years 2020 and 2019 , respectively , to recognize base rent on a straight-line basis . in addition , base rent includes $ 1.4 million and $ 1.4 million for the years 2020 and 2019 , respectively , to recognize income from the amortization of in-place leases . total revenue decreased 2.7 % in 2020 compared to 2019 as described below . base rent the $ 2.9 million increase in base rent in 2020 compared to 2019 was attributable to higher residential base rent , primarily due to the waycroft , which was completed in april 2020 ( $ 2.6 million ) . expense recoveries expense recovery income decreased $ 1.8 million in 2020 compared to 2019 primarily due to a decrease in recoverable property operating expenses , largely repairs and maintenance and snow removal . credit losses on operating lease receivables credit losses increased $ 4.0 million in 2020 compared to 2019 , primarily due to increased reserves across the portfolio as a result of the impact of covid-19 on tenant operations . other revenue other revenue decreased $ 3.2 million in 2020 compared to 2019 primarily due to lower lease termination fees ( $ 1.9 million ) and lower parking income ( $ 1.4 million ) .

"provide insight into important areas of management 's focus . this section should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in this annual report . this discussion includes forward-looking statements that involve certain risks and uncertainties . for periods prior to june 20 , 2011 , the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements and related notes represent the combined financial position , results of operations , cash flows and changes in net parent equity of our predecessor , which consists of the assets , liabilities and operations of compressco , inc. and its subsidiaries and certain assets , liabilities and operations of certain other subsidiaries of tetra conducting business primarily in mexico ( together , our predecessor ) . for the periods on and after june 20 , 2011 , the accompanying consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto represent our financial position , results of operations , cash flows , and changes in partners ' capital . statements in the following discussion may include forward-looking statements . these forward- looking statements involve risks and uncertainties . see “ item 1a . risk factors , ” for additional discussion of these factors and risks . business overview we are a provider of compression-based production enhancement services , which are used in both conventional wellhead compression applications and unconventional compression applications , and , in certain circumstances , well monitoring and sand separation services . we provide our services to a broad base of natural gas and oil exploration and production companies operating throughout many of the onshore producing regions of the united states . internationally , we have significant operations in mexico and canada and a growing presence in certain countries in south america , eastern europe , and the asia-pacific region . over time , oil and natural gas wells exhibit declining pressure and production . production enhancement technologies are designed to enhance daily production and total recoverable reserves . our conventional compression-based production enhancement services are utilized to increase production by deliquifying wells , lowering wellhead pressure , and increasing gas velocity . our conventional applications include production enhancement services for dry gas wells and liquid-loaded gas wells , and backside auto injection systems ( “ bais ” ) for liquid-loaded gas wells . our unconventional applications are utilized primarily in connection with oil and liquids production and include vapor recovery and casing gas system applications . in certain circumstances , in connection with our primary production enhancement services , we also provide ongoing well monitoring services and automated sand separation services . while our conventional applications are primarily associated with mature gas wells with low formation pressures , they are also effectively utilized on newer gas wells that have experienced significant production declines . our field services are performed by our highly trained staff of regional service supervisors , optimization specialists , and field mechanics . in addition , we design and manufacture most of the compressor units we use to provide our services , and , in certain markets , we sell our compressor units to customers . the level of our production enhancement services operations is generally dependent upon the demand for , and p rices of , natural gas in the locations in which we operate . however , despite significantly lower domestic natural gas prices during 2012 compared to 2011 , our overall production enhancement service revenues increased . nevertheless , any prolonged substantial reduction in natural gas prices could result in a decline in demand for our production enhancement services . overall , our total revenues increased during the year ended december 31 , 2012 , compared to the prio r year . this increase reflects : increased compression and well monitoring services in latin america ; growth of the fleet within our other international operations ; and improved overall utilization of the existing fleet , including for our unconventional applications , primarily in vapor recovery applications . the increased activity in latin america has required investments in fixed assets and working capital and resulted in additional personnel and related administrative services provided under the omnibus agreement and other related party agreements with tetra . our ability to maintain the increased activity in latin america is subject to potential volatility relating to our mexico operations as addressed in more detail under “ liquidity and c apital resources - cash flows. ” 32 how we evaluate our operations operating expenses . we use operating expenses as a performance measure for our business . we track our operating expenses using month-to-month , year-to-date , and year-to-year comparisons , and as compared to budget . this analysis is useful in identifying adverse cost trends and allows us to investigate the cause of these trends and implement remedial measures if possible . the most significant portions of our operating expenses are the labor costs of our field personnel , repair and maintenance of our equipment , and the fuel and other supplies consumed while providing our services . other materials consumed while performing our services , ad valorem taxes , other labor costs , truck maintenance , rent on storage facilities , and insurance expenses comprise the significant remainder of our operating expenses . our operating expenses generally fluctuate with the level of activities performed . our labor costs consist primarily of wages and benefits for our field personnel , as well as expenses related to their training and safety . additional information regarding our operating expenses for the period ended december 31 , 2011 and the year ended december 31 , 2012 , is provided within the results of operations sections below . ebitda . we view ebitda as one of our primary management tools , and we track it on a monthly basis , both in dollars and as a percentage of revenue s ( compared to the prior month , prior year period , and to budget ) . we define ebitda as earnings before interest , taxes , depreciation , and amortization . story_separator_special_tag we assumed approximately $ 32.2 million of this indebtedness ( as partial consideration for the assets we acquired from tetra in connection with the offering ) , and this $ 32.2 million balance was repaid in full from the proceeds of the offering . the balance of this intercompany indebtedness was repaid prior to the offering . on june 24 , 2011 , we entered into a credit agreement , and we borrowed $ 10.1 million under that credit agreement during the second half of 2012. as of december 31 , 2012 , we have availability under our revolving credit facility of $ 9.6 million , based upon a $ 19.6 million borrowing capacity and the $ 10.1 million outstanding balance , and the credit agreement includes an uncommitted $ 20,0 million expansion feature . borrowings bear interest at a rate equal to three month british bankers association libor ( adjusted to reflect any required bank reserves ) plus a margin of 2.25 % per annum . the weighted average interest rate on outstanding borrowings at december 31 , 2012 , was 2.5986 % per annum . we incur additional general and administrative expenses of approximately $ 2.5 million per year as a result of being a publicly traded limited partnership , including costs associated with annual and quarterly reports to our unitholders , annual financial audits , schedule k-1 preparation and distribution , investor relations activities , registrar and transfer agent fees , legal fees , director and executive officer liability insurance costs , and director compensation . given our partnership structure and cash distribution policy , we distribute all of our “ available cash ” from “ operating surplus ” or “ capital surplus ” ( as such terms are defined in our partnership agreement ) at the end of each quarter . we are not a restricted subsidiary of tetra for purposes of tetra 's credit facility with j.p. morgan chase bank , n.a. , as administrative agent , which we refer to as the “ tetra credit facility , ” or under several series of notes that tetra has issued pursuant to certain note purchase agreements in april 2006 , april 2008 , and october 2010 , which we collectively refer to as the “ tetra senior notes. ” as such , our ability to take certain actions , including incurring indebtedness , granting liens on our assets , and making acquisitions and capital expenditures , will not be restricted by the tetra credit facility and the tetra senior notes . critical accounting policies and estimates this discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements . we prepared these financial statements in conformity with united states generally accepted accounting principles . in preparing our co nsolidated financial statements , we make assumptions , estimates , and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the periods presented . we base these estimates on historical experience , available information , and various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances . we periodically evaluate these estimates and judgments , including those related to potential impairments of long-lived assets ( including goodwill ) , the useful life of long-lived assets , the collectability of accounts receivable , and the allocation of certain parent company administrative costs . these judgments and estimates may change as new events occur , as new information is acquired , and with changes in our operating environment . actual results are likely to differ from current estimates , and those differences may be material . the following critical accounting policies reflect the most significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements . 35 impairment of long-lived assets we conduct a determination of impairment of long-lived assets periodically whenever indicators of impairment are present . if such indicators are present , the determination of the amount of impairment is based on our judgments as to the future operating cash flows to be generated from these assets throughout their estimated useful lives . if an impairment of a long-lived asset is warranted , we estimate the fair value of the asset based on a present value of these cash flows or the value that could be realized from disposing of the asset in a transaction between market participants . the estimation of future operating cash flows is inherently imprecise , and , if our estimates are materially incorrect , it could result in an overstatement or understatement of our financial position and results of operations . in particular , the oil and gas industry is cyclical , and estimates of the period over which future cash flows will be generated , as well as the predictability of these cash flows , can have an additional significant impact on the carrying value of these assets and , particularly in periods of prolonged down cycles , may result in impairment charges . historically , our business has not experienced significant impairments of its long-lived compressor assets , as utilized compressor units generate cash flows sufficient to support their carrying values . unutilized assets are well maintained and evaluated on a regular basis . serviceable compressor units that are currently unutilized are anticipated to be placed in service in future years as demand increases or as fully depreciated units in service are replaced . sales of compressor units have historically been at selling prices in excess of asset cost . while we have not experienced significant impairments in the past , impairments of our long-lived assets could occur in the future , particularly in the event of a significant and sustained deterioration of natural gas production . impairment of goodwill goodwill represents the excess of cost over the fair value of the net assets of businesses acquired in purchase transactions . we perform a goodwill impairment test on an annual basis or whenever indicators of impairment are present .
","in our results of operations . equity-based compensation our general partner adopted the compressco partners , l.p. 2011 long term incentive plan , which provide s for the granting of restricted units and other equity-based awards . the compensation cost for all equity-based grants under the 2011 long term incentive plan is based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with accounting standards codification 718 — “ compensation — stock compensation. ” we estimate expected pre-vesting forfeitures based on actual historical pre-vesting forfeitures over the most recent periods for the expected term . prior to the offering , tetra made grant s to certain of our predecessor 's employees of stock options and restricted shares of tetra common stock . compensation cost associated with such outstanding awards to our predecessor 's employees was included in the financial statements of our predecessor . all of these estimates are inherently imprecise and may result in compensation cost being recorded that is materially different from the actual fair value of the awards granted . while the assumptions for volatility and pre-vesting forfeiture rate are updated with each year 's option-valuing process , there have not been significant revisions made in these estimates to date . methodologies used to allocate parent company administrative costs tetra provides us with centralized corporate functions such as legal , accounting and financial reporting , treasury , insurance administration , claims processing , risk management , health , safety and environmental , information technology , human resources , credit , payroll , internal audit , taxes and other corporate services . since the offering , these services are performed pursuant to the omnibus agreement between us and tetra . prior to june 20 , 2011 , our predecessor 's financial statements reflected an estimated allocation of the cost of tetra 's general and administrative costs incurred on our behalf .

"we believe the following are our critical accounting policies , because they have a material impact on the portrayal of our financial condition and results , and they require us to make judgments and estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain . income tax expense : we have elected to be treated as a reit , as defined in the internal revenue code of 1986 , as amended ( the “ code ” ) . as a reit , we do not incur federal income tax on our reit taxable income that is fully distributed each year ( for this purpose , certain distributions paid in a subsequent year may be considered ) , and if we meet certain organizational and operational rules . we believe we have met these reit requirements for all periods presented herein . accordingly , we have recorded no federal income tax expense related to our reit taxable income . our evaluation that we have met the reit requirements could be incorrect , because compliance with the tax rules requires factual determinations , and circumstances we have not identified could result in noncompliance with the tax requirements in current or prior years . for any taxable year that we fail to qualify as a reit and for which applicable statutory relief provisions did not apply , we would be taxed at the regular corporate rates on all of our taxable income for at least that year and the ensuing four years , we could be subject to penalties and interest , and our net income would be materially different from the amounts estimated in our financial statements . in addition , certain of our consolidated corporate subsidiaries have elected to be treated as “ taxable reit subsidiaries ” for federal income tax purposes , which are taxable as regular corporations and subject to certain limitations on intercompany transactions . if tax authorities determine that amounts paid by our taxable reit subsidiaries to us are not reasonable compared to similar arrangements among unrelated parties , we could be subject to a 100 % penalty tax on the excess payments . such a penalty tax could have a material adverse impact on our net income . impairment of long-lived assets : the analysis of impairment of our long-lived assets involves identification of indicators of impairment , projections of future operating cash flows , and estimates of fair values , all of which require significant judgment and subjectivity . others could come to materially different conclusions . in addition , we may not have identified all current facts and circumstances that may affect impairment . any unidentified impairment loss , or change in conclusions , could have a material adverse impact on our net income . accrual for uncertain and contingent liabilities : we accrue for certain contingent and other liabilities that have significant uncertain elements , such as property taxes , workers compensation claims , tenant reinsurance claims , as well as other legal claims and disputes involving customers , employees , governmental agencies and other third parties . we estimate such liabilities based upon many factors such as assumptions of past and future trends and our evaluation of likely outcomes . however , the estimates of known liabilities could be incorrect or we may not be aware of all such liabilities , in which case our accrued liabilities and net income could be misstated . accounting for acquired real estate facilities : we estimate the fair values of the land , buildings and intangible assets acquired for purposes of allocating the purchase price . such estimates are based upon many assumptions and judgments , including ( i ) market rates of return and capitalization rates on real estate and intangible assets , ( ii ) building and material cost levels , ( iii ) comparisons of the acquired underlying land parcels to recent land 25 transactions , and ( iv ) future cash flows from the real estate and the existing tenant base . others could come to materially different conclusions as to the estimated fair values , which would result in different depreciation and amortization expense , gains and losses on sale of real estate assets , and real estate and intangible assets . overview our self-storage operations generate most of our net income , and we believe that our earnings growth is most impacted by the level of organic growth in our existing self-storage portfolio . accordingly , a significant portion of management 's time is devoted to maximizing cash flows from our existing self-storage facilities . most of our facilities compete with other well-managed and well-located competitors and we are subject to general economic conditions , particularly those that affect the spending habits of consumers and moving trends . we believe that our centralized information networks , national telephone and online reservation system , the brand name “ public storage , ” and our economies of scale enable us to meet such challenges effectively . in the last three years , there has been a marked increase in development of new self-storage facilities in many of the markets we operate in , due to the favorable economics of development which we have also taken advantage of . these newly developed facilities compete with many of the facilities we own , negatively impacting our occupancies , rental rates , and rental growth . this increase in supply has been most notable in atlanta , austin , charlotte , chicago , dallas , denver , houston , new york , and portland . we plan on growing organically as well as through the acquisition and development of new facilities and expanding our existing self-storage facilities . since the beginning of 2013 through december 31 , 2018 , we acquired a total of 296 facilities with 20.6 million net rentable square feet from third parties for approximately $ 2 . 7 billion , and we opened newly developed and expanded self-storage space for a total cost of $ 1.2 billion , adding approximately 1 1.3 million net rentable square feet . story_separator_special_tag however , core ffo per share is not a substitute for net income per share . because other reits may not compute core ffo per share in the same manner as we do , may not use the same terminology or may not present such a measure , core ffo per share may not be comparable among reits . 29 the following table reconciles ffo per share to core ffo per share : ﻿ replace_table_token_3_th analysis of net income by reportable segment the following discussion and analysis is presented and organized in accordance with note 11 to our december 31 , 201 8 financial statements , “ segment information. ” accordingly , refer to the tables presented in note 11 in order to reconcile such amounts to our total net income and for further information on our reportable segments . self-storage operations our self-storage operations are analyzed in two groups : ( i ) the 2,046 facilities that we have owned and operated on a stabilized basis since january 1 , 2016 ( the “ same store facilities ” ) , and ( ii ) all other facilities , which are newly acquired , newly developed , recently redeveloped , or are otherwise not stabilized with respect to occupancies or rental rates since january 1 , 2016 ( the “ non same store facilities ” ) . see note 11 to our december 31 , 2018 financial statements “ segment information , ” for a reconciliation of the amounts in the tables below to our total net income . 30 ﻿ ﻿ replace_table_token_4_th ( a ) net operating income or “ noi ” is a non-gaap financial measure that excludes the impact of depreciation and amortization expense , which is based upon historical real estate costs and assumes that building values diminish ratably over time , while we believe that real estate values fluctuate due to market conditions . we utilize noi in determining current property values , evaluating property performance , and in evaluating property operating trends . we believe that investors and analysts utilize noi in a similar manner . noi is not a substitute for net income , net operating cash flow , or other related gaap financial measures , in evaluating our operating results . see note 11 to our december 31 , 2018 financial statements for a reconciliation of noi to our total net income for all periods presented . net operating income from our self-storage operations has increased 2 . 5 % in 201 8 as compared to 201 7 and 3.7 % in 201 7 as compared to 201 6 . these increases are due to higher revenues in our same store facilities , as well as the acquisition and development of new facilities and the fill-up of unstabilized facilities . 31 same store facilities the same store facilities represent those facilities that have been owned and operated at a stabilized level of occupancy , revenues and cost of operations since january 1 , 2016. we review the operations of our same store facilities , which excludes facilities whose operating trends are significantly affected by factors such as casualty events , as well as recently developed or acquired facilities , to more effectively evaluate the ongoing performance of our self-storage portfolio in 2016 , 2017 , and 2018. we believe the same store information is used by investors and reit analysts in a similar manner . the following table summarizes the historical operating results of these 2,046 facilities ( 131.2 million net rentable square feet ) that represent approximately 81 % of the aggregate net rentable square feet of our u.s. consolidated self-storage portfolio at december 31 , 2018 . ﻿ replace_table_token_5_th 32 ( a ) revenues and cost of operations do not include tenant reinsurance and merchandise sale revenues and expenses generated at the facilities . see “ ancillary operations ” below for more information . ( b ) realized annual rent per occupied square foot is computed by dividing rental income , before late charges and administrative fees , by the weighted average occupied square feet for the period . realized annual rent per available square foot ( “ revpaf ” ) is computed by dividing rental income , before late charges and administrative fees , by the total available net rentable square feet for the period . these measures exclude late charges and administrative fees in order to provide a better measure of our ongoing level of revenue . late charges are dependent upon the level of delinquency and administrative fees are dependent upon the level of move-ins . in addition , the rates charged for late charges and administrative fees can vary independently from rental rates . these measures take into consideration promotional discounts , which reduce rental income . ( c ) annual contract rent represents the agreed upon monthly rate that is paid by our tenants in place at the time of measurement . contract rates are initially set in the lease agreement upon move-in and we adjust them from time to time with notice . contract rent excludes other fees that are charged on a per-item basis , such as late charges and administrative fees , does not reflect the impact of promotional discounts , and does not reflect the impact of rents that are written off as uncollectible . analysis of same store revenue revenues generated by our same store facilities increased by 1 . 5 % in 201 8 as compared to 201 7 and by 3.0 % in 201 7 as compared to 201 6 , due primarily to increases in realized annual rent per occupied square foot of 2 . 3 % and 3 . 9 % in 201 8 and 201 7 , respectively , as compared to the previous year . same store revenue growth on a year over year basis declined from 3.0 % in 201 7 to 1.5 % in 201 8 , due to softness in demand in substantially all of our major markets , which has led to a lack of pricing power with respect to new tenants .
","results of operations operating results for 201 8 and 201 7 in 2018 , net income allocable to our common shareholders was $ 1,488.9 million or $ 8.54 per diluted common share , compared to $ 1,171.6 million or $ 6.73 per diluted common share in 2017 rep resenting an increase of $ 317.3 million or $ 1.81 per diluted common share . the increase is due primarily to ( i ) $ 183.1 million in aggregate gains due to shurgard europe 's initial public offering and the sale of our facility in west london to shurgard europe , ( ii ) a $ 47.1 million increase in self-storage net operating income ( described below ) , ( iii ) our $ 37.7 million equity share of gains recorded by ps business parks in 2018 , ( iv ) a $ 68.2 million increase due to the impact of foreign currency exchange gains and losses associated with our euro denominated debt , ( v ) a $ 29.3 million allocation to preferred shareholders associated with preferred share redemptions in 2017 and ( vi ) a $ 7.8 million casualty loss and $ 5.2 million in incremental tenant reinsurance losses related to hurricanes harvey and irma in 2017. these impacts were offset partially by a $ 36.1 million increase in general and administrative expense due to the acceleration of share-based compensation expense accruals for our former ceo and cfo in 2018 as a result of their retirement on december 31 , 2018 and the reversal of share-based compensation accruals forfeited by retiring senior executive officers in 2017. the $ 47.1 million increase in self-storage net operating income is a result of a $ 15.6 million increase in our same store facilities and $ 31.5 million increase in our non same store facilities .

"the forward-looking statements are made as of the date of this annual report , and we assume no obligation to update the forward-looking statements , or to update the reasons why actual results could differ from those projected in the forward-looking statements . investors should consult all of the information set forth in this report and the other information set forth from time to time in our reports filed with the securities and exchange commission pursuant to the securities act of 1933 and the securities exchange act of 1934 , including our reports on forms 10-q and 8-k. the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in item 8 of this annual report . 23 overview we offer a state-of-the-art digital publishing platform . we use this platform to power our consumer-facing mobile personalization app , called zedge , available in the google play store and itunes , which offers an easy , entertaining and immersive way for end-users to engage with our rich and diverse catalogue of wallpapers , stickers , ringtones , notification sounds and video wallpapers . we are evolving by developing new , entertainment-focused apps , that will run on our publishing platform . we secure our content from artists , both amateurs and professionals as well as emerging and major brands . artists have the ability to easily launch a virtual storefront in our zedge app where they can market and sell their content to our user base . our zedge app has been installed more than 396 million times , boasts more than 33 million monthly active users , or mau , and has consistently averaged in the ‘ top 60 ' most popular free apps in the google play store in the united states . mau is a key performance indicator that captures the number of unique users that used our zedge app during the previous 30-day period . historically , we have not made a material investment in paid user acquisition for our zedge app . our zedge app 's success stems from its ability to meet consumer demand for a rich and diverse catalogue of both long-tail and popular content , to offer reliable search and discovery capabilities and to make relevant content recommendations to our users . our zedge app utilizes both user-generated and licensed , third-party content to achieve these goals . in march 2018 , we launched as part of the zedge app zedge premium , a marketplace where professional creators and brands can market , distribute and sell their digital content to our consumers . since launching zedge premium , we have been testing various ways to best market and sell creators ' digital art . to date , a large portion of our resources with zedge premium have been dedicated to homepage design and promotion needed for marketing lift and rewarded paywall and zedge credit , our closed virtual currency , sales for revenue optimization . we still have material work that is needed to achieve these goals . over time , we expect that zedge premium will contribute to a virtuous cycle whereby it drives new consumers into our zedge app resulting in more artist payouts , which in turn makes the platform more attractive for artists and brands looking to expand their reach and increase their income . in september of 2017 , we closed a transaction with freeform development , inc. , or freeform , and retained their development personnel in order to accelerate the launch and development of zedge premium . in january 2019 , we started testing an option by which our zedge app 's users can remove unsolicited advertisements from our zedge app by paying a fee . as of july 31 , 2019 , we amassed 129,000 active ‘ ad-free ' subscribers . in fiscal 2020 , we hope to further optimize the offer based on user type , geography and price point as well as introduce new subscription enhancements like content bundles and rewards . we believe that our zedge app 's popularity stems from its ability to provide users with a rich array of relevant digital content in a fun , intuitive and user-friendly fashion that aligns with their interest in expressing their essence in a bespoke manner . to this end , we invest heavily in both product design and development and the underlying technology required to satisfy both our zedge app 's users ' and content contributors ' expectations . as of july 31 , 2019 , approximately 54 % of our zedge app 's user base was located in north america and europe , evenly split between the regions . over the past several years , we have experienced a shift in our regional customer make-up with mau increasing in emerging markets and decreasing in well-developed markets . in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019 , users in emerging markets grew by 8.2 % while users in well-developed economies declined 18.3 % when compared to the same period in fiscal 2018. this shift has negatively impacted revenue generation because well-developed markets command materially higher advertising rates when compared to those in emerging markets . mau growth is tightly coupled with securing new users . historically , our high ranking in the google play store has been one of the primary drivers for securing new users . although still an important factor , we have started dedicating resources to growth initiatives , both organic and paid . with time , we believe that we can change our growth dynamic in well-developed markets . aside from formal growth initiatives , we need to continually improve the core user experience test different mechanisms and content verticals that may spur growth and capitalize on the role that zedge premium artists can have on driving new users into the platform . historically , we have generated approximately 90 % of our revenues from selling our zedge app 's advertising inventory to advertising networks , advertising exchanges , and direct arrangements with advertisers . story_separator_special_tag 2. application and infrastructure development stage activities focus on acquiring or developing hardware and software to operate a content distribution platform or new product and service ; and 3. post-implementation/operating stage activities address training , administration , maintenance , and all other activities to operate an existing content distribution platform or new product or service . 25 during the planning stage , we charge all costs to expense as incurred . during the application and infrastructure development stage , we begin to capitalize costs when the project has been properly authorized and we determine that completion is probable . if a project is subsequently cancelled prior to placement in service , costs that have been capitalized to date will be reviewed for potential impairment . capitalization ceases no later than the point at which a computer software project is substantially complete and ready for its intended use . amortization begins for each project when the code is ready for use , whether or not it is actually placed in service at that time ( an exception being if the project 's functionality completely depends on the completion of another project ; then , amortization begins when that other project is ready for use ) . during the post-implementation/operation stage , we expense training costs and maintenance costs as incurred . however , upgrades and enhancements , defined as modifications to existing internal-use software that result in additional functionality ( modifications to enable the software to perform tasks that it was previously incapable of performing , normally requiring new software specifications and perhaps a change to all or part of the existing software specifications ) are treated as though they were new projects , and are assessed utilizing the same stages and criteria on a project by project basis . as such , internal costs incurred for upgrades and enhancements are expensed or capitalized based on the requirements noted above , while costs incurred for maintenance are expensed as incurred . these projects are tracked individually , such that the beginning and ending of the capitalization can be appropriately established , as well as the amounts capitalized therein . amortization of these costs is included in depreciation and amortization in the statement of comprehensive loss . revenue recognition . the company generates revenue from three sources : ( 1 ) advertising ; ( 2 ) service ; and ( 3 ) other . approximately 90 % of the company 's revenue is generated from selling its advertising inventory ( “ advertising revenue ” ) to advertising networks , advertising exchanges , and direct arrangements with advertisers . approximately 7 % of the company 's annual revenue for fiscal 2019 related to its managing and optimizing the advertising inventory of a third-party mobile application publisher , as well as overseeing the billing , collections and reporting related to advertising for this publisher ( “ service revenue ” ) . the contract with this publisher was terminated effective may 31 , 2019. the remaining revenue is a combination of subscriptions and from sales under zedge premium ( “ other revenue ” ) which were introduced in january 2019 and march 2018 , respectively . currently , subscription revenue allows users to prepay a monthly or annual fee to remove unsolicited advertisements from the zedge app although the company is working on adding additional capabilities to subscriptions including offering subscriptions to ios customers . the company retains 30 % as fee when users purchase licensed content using zedge credits or unlock licensed content by watching a video or taking a survey on zedge premium . advertising revenue : the company generates the bulk of its revenue from selling its zedge app 's advertising inventory to advertising networks and advertising exchanges and direct sales to advertisers . the company also generates revenue from app publishers that pay the company for installations of their app . ● advertising networks . an advertising network is a third-party relationship where buyers of advertising inventory go to purchase either specific targeted inventory or a large scale of inventory at a set price . advertising networks serve as an indirect source of advertising fill to a variety of branded ad campaigns and performance-based ad campaigns . ● advertising exchanges . an advertising exchange is similar to an advertising network , except that the exchange typically bids in real-time for inventory . advertisers may utilize an exchange when looking for scale or specific audiences , and accept that the price will vary based on when and how much volume of inventory they wish to buy . ● direct sales to advertisers . the company sells advertising directly to advertisers through a contractual relationship . these relationships typically offer higher than average pricing than realized from sales via advertising networks or advertising exchanges . ● app installs . the company earns revenue when a zedge user installs an app offered by a publisher in the game channel that pays the company a pre-negotiated fee for the installation ( referred to as cost per install or cpi ) . in october 2018 , the company replaced the game channel with a game wall which offers zedge users with a mix of interactive playable ads which , if installed by the user , generate revenue for zedge . the company is expected to discontinue game wall in fiscal 2020. the company recognizes advertising revenue as advertisements are delivered to users through impressions , ad views or app installs ( depending on the terms agreed upon with the advertiser ) . for in-app display ads , in-app offers , engagement advertisements and other advertisements , the company 's performance obligation is satisfied over the life of the relevant contract ( i.e. , over time ) , with revenue being recognized as advertising units are delivered . the advertiser may compensate the company on a cost-per-impression , cost-per-click , cost-per-action or cost-per-install basis .
","results of operations fiscal year ended july 31 , 2019 compared to fiscal year ended july 31 , 2018 replace_table_token_1_th nm-not meaningful revenues . revenues declined 18.6 % in fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 primarily due to the combination of the shift in the makeup of our user base from well-developed markets , that command relatively higher advertising rates , to emerging markets , where the rates are lower , the cancellation of the agreement for managing a third-party mobile application publisher that took effect on may 31 , 2019 and the discontinuation of certain monetization mechanisms in august 2018. the revenue decline was partially offset by new revenue streams from zedge premium and our subscription offerings , both of which are early stage and will take time to reach their full potential . our mau decreased by 2.8 % to 33.8 million at the end of fiscal 2019 from 34.8 million at the end of fiscal 2018. users in emerging markets grew by 8.2 % while users in well-developed regions declined 18.3 % at the end of q4 of fiscal 2019 when compared to the same period in fiscal 2018. primarily as a result of this geographical shift in our overall user base and the discontinuation of certain monetization mechanisms , our average revenue per monthly active user , or arpmau , from our apps decreased 20.3 % to $ 0.0196 in fiscal 2019 from $ 0.0246 in fiscal 2018. we completed the initial rollout of zedge premium in march 2018 to a certain segment of our android user base and we expanded it to 100 % of our android user base in january 2019. in fiscal 2019 , gross transaction value ( the total sales volume transacting through the platform , or “ gtv ” ) and net revenue generated from zedge premium were $ 485,000 and $ 130,000 respectively . in fiscal 2018 , gtv and net revenue generated from zedge premium were $ 42,000 and $ 16,000 respectively .

the cyclical and general competitive nature of the property and casualty insurance industry and general uncertainties regarding loss reserves or other estimates ; the accuracy and adequacy of the company 's pricing methodologies ; the company 's success in managing its business in states outside of california ; the impact of potential third party bad-faith legislation , changes in laws , regulations or new interpretations of existing laws and regulations , tax position challenges by the california franchise tax board ( ftb ) , and decisions of courts , regulators and governmental bodies , particularly in california ; the company 's ability to obtain and the timing of the approval of premium rate changes for insurance policies issued in states where the company operates ; the company 's reliance on independent agents to market and distribute its policies ;

however , the company is unable to predict the trend of loss frequency in the future . underwriting cycle and competition the property and casualty insurance industry is highly cyclical , with alternating hard and soft market conditions . the company has historically seen significant premium growth during hard markets . premium growth rates in soft markets have ranged from slightly positive to negative and were consistent in 2011. technology in 2011 , the company continued to enhance its internet agency portal , mercury first . mercury first is a single entry point for agents providing a broad suite of capabilities . one of its most powerful tools is a point of sale ( pos ) system that allows agents to easily obtain and compare quotes and write new business . mercury first 36 is designed as an easy-to-use agency portal that provides a customized work queue for each agency user showing new business leads , underwriting requests and other pertinent customer information in real time . agents can also assist customers with processing payments , reporting claims or updating their records . the system enables quick access to documents and forms and empowers the agents with several self-service capabilities . the nextgen system is designed to be a multi-state , multi-line system . nextgen serves as the primary platform for all underwriting , billing , claims , and commission functions supporting the private passenger auto line in seven states ( virginia , new york , florida , california , georgia , illinois , and texas ) . during 2010 , the company launched guidewire , a commercially available software solution , to replace legacy platforms and implemented it for the nevada homeowners line . in 2011 , the company expanded the guidewire implementation to texas , georgia , illinois , pennsylvania , and oklahoma for the homeowners line of business and for the texas commercial auto line of business . the company plans to expand guidewire to other states and lines of business during 2012. in 2011 , as part of its continuing commitment to service excellence , the company piloted in georgia a new web capability for customers to bind and pay for new policies online . these policies will be serviced by the company 's independent agents . the company plans to expand this capability to other states in the future . b. regulatory and legal matters the process for implementing rate changes varies by state , with california , georgia , new york , new jersey , pennsylvania , and nevada requiring prior approval from the respective doi before a rate may be implemented . illinois , texas , virginia , arizona , and michigan only require that rates be filed with the doi . oklahoma and florida have a modified version of prior approval laws . in all states , the insurance code provides that rates must not be excessive , inadequate , or unfairly discriminatory . for the company 's two largest lines of business , personal automobile and homeowners , the company filed rate changes that were neutral in seven states and increases in thirteen states during 2011. the california doi uses rating factor regulations requiring automobile insurance rates to be determined in decreasing order of importance by ( 1 ) driving safety record , ( 2 ) miles driven per year , ( 3 ) years of driving experience , and ( 4 ) other factors as determined by the california doi to have a substantial relationship to the risk of loss and adopted by regulation . during 2011 , the company received approval from the california doi to implement a revenue neutral personal automobile class plan filing . the company expects the plan will improve the pricing structure to better align premium rates charged with risks insured . the new plan will lead to decreased rates for some risks and increased rates for others . as a result , the company may experience a short-term decrease in the number of policies renewed . preliminary indications are that policy renewals have only decreased slightly ; however , it is currently unknown what the full extent , if any , of the possible decrease will be . the plan was implemented in december 2011 and is expected to make the company more competitive in attracting new personal automobile insurance business . on april 9 , 2010 , the california doi issued a notice of non-compliance ( 2010 nnc ) to mic , mcc , and caic based on a report of examination of the rating and underwriting practices of these companies issued by the california doi on february 18 , 2010. the 2010 nnc includes allegations of 35 instances of noncompliance with applicable california insurance law and seeks to require that each of mic , mcc , and caic change its rating and underwriting practices to rectify the alleged noncompliance and may also seek monetary penalties .
","results of operations year ended december 31 , 2011 compared to year ended december 31 , 2010 revenues net premiums earned in 2011 were essentially the same as 2010 while net premiums written in 2011 increased by approximately $ 20 million from 2010. net premiums written by the company 's california operations were approximately $ 2 billion in 2011 , a 0.4 % decrease from 2010. net premiums written by the company 's non-california operations were approximately $ 632 million in 2011 , a 4.5 % increase from 2010. growth outside of california has come as a result of expanded and improved product offerings and higher average premiums per policy . net premiums written is a non-gaap financial measure which represents the premiums charged on policies issued during a fiscal period less any applicable reinsurance . net premiums written is a statutory measure designed to determine production levels . net premiums earned , the most directly comparable gaap measure , represents the portion of net premiums written that is recognized as revenue in the financial statements for the period presented and earned on a pro-rata basis over the term of the policies . the following is a reconciliation of total net premiums written to net premiums earned : replace_table_token_19_th 46 expenses loss and expense ratios are used to interpret the underwriting experience of property and casualty insurance companies . the following table presents the company 's consolidated loss , expense , and combined ratios determined in accordance with gaap : replace_table_token_20_th loss ratio is calculated by dividing losses and loss adjustment expenses by net premiums earned . the company 's loss ratio for 2011 was generally consistent with the 2010 loss ratio .

"employee contributions are matched by the company at the rate of $ .50 per story_separator_special_tag general the company 's worldwide operations are primarily driven by the number of oil and natural gas wells being drilled , the depth and drilling conditions of such wells , the number of well completions and the level of workover activity . drilling activity , in turn , is largely dependent on the price of crude oil and natural gas . this situation often leads to volatility in the company 's revenue and profitability , especially in the united states and canada , where the company historically has generated in excess of 50 % of its revenue . for the twelve months ended september 30 , 2003 , the active u.s. rig count averaged 966 rigs , an 11 % increase from fiscal 2002. for the twelve months ended september 30 , 2002 , the active u.s. rig count averaged 870 rigs , a 26 % decrease from fiscal 2001. much of the decrease occurred in the number of rigs drilling for natural gas , which for fiscal 2002 decreased 23 % from the previous fiscal year . the company 's management believes that the average u.s. rig count for fiscal 2004 will be approximately 14 % higher than fiscal 2003 , essentially flat with current levels of approximately 1,100 rigs . drilling activity outside north america has historically been less volatile than drilling activity in the u.s. and canada . active international drilling rigs ( excluding canada ) averaged 761 rigs during fiscal 2003 , an increase of 4 % from fiscal 2002. during 2002 , active international drilling rigs ( excluding canada ) averaged 730 rigs , a decrease of 1 % from fiscal 2001. in canada , drilling activity averaged 341 rigs during fiscal 2003 , an increase of 29 % from fiscal 2002. canadian drilling activity declined in fiscal 2002 averaging 265 active drilling rigs , down 27 % from the previous fiscal year . the company expects international drilling activity outside of canada to remain relatively flat for fiscal 2004 compared to fiscal 2003. drilling activity in canada is expected to increase approximately 5 % for fiscal 2004 over fiscal 2003. critical accounting policies in may 2002 , the sec issued a proposed rule : disclosure in management 's discussion and analysis about the application of critical accounting policies. although the sec has not issued a final rule , the following discussion has been prepared on the basis of the guidelines in the sec rule proposal . the proposed rule would require disclosures of critical accounting estimates . for an accounting policy to be deemed critical , the accounting policy must first include an estimate that requires a company to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimate is made . second , different estimates that the company reasonably could have used for the accounting estimate in the current period , or changes in the accounting estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period , must have a material impact on the presentation of the company 's financial condition or results of operations . estimates and assumptions about future events and their effects can not be perceived with certainty . the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances , the results of which form the basis for making judgments . these estimates may change as new events occur , as more experience is acquired , as additional information is obtained and as the company 's operating environment changes . materially different results can occur as circumstances change and additional information becomes known , including estimates not deemed critical under the proposed rule by the sec . the company believes the following are the most critical accounting policies used in the preparation of the company 's consolidated financial statements and the significant judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of these policies . the selection of accounting estimates , including those deemed critical ,  and the associated disclosures in this discussion have been discussed by management with the audit committee of the board of directors . the critical accounting policies should be read in conjunction with the disclosures elsewhere in the notes to the consolidated financial statements . significant accounting policies are discussed in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements . goodwill : effective october 1 , 2001 , the company adopted statement of financial accounting standards no . 142 , goodwill and other intangible assets ( sfas 142 ) . sfas 142 requires that goodwill no longer be amortized to earnings . sfas 142 requires goodwill to be reviewed for possible impairment using fair value 22 measurement techniques on an annual basis , or if circumstances indicate that an impairment may exist . specifically , goodwill impairment is determined using a two-step process . the first step of the goodwill impairment test compares the fair value of a reporting unit to its net book value , including goodwill . if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the net book value , no impairment is required and the second step is unnecessary . if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the net book value , the second step is performed to determine the amount of the impairment , if any . fair value measures include quoted market price , present value technique ( estimate of future cash flows ) , and a valuation technique based on multiples of earnings or revenue . the second step compares the implied fair value of a reporting unit with the net book value of the reporting unit . if the net book value of a reporting unit exceeds the implied fair value , an impairment loss shall be recognized in the amount equal to that excess . the implied fair value is determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination . story_separator_special_tag at september 30 , 2003 and september 30 , 2002 , self-insurance accruals totaled $ 14.8 million and $ 12.3 million , respectively . as discussed in note 10 of the consolidated financial statements , legal proceedings covering a wide range of matters are pending or threatened against the company . it is not possible to predict the outcome of the litigation pending against the company and litigation is subject to many uncertainties . it is possible that there could be adverse developments in these cases . the company records provisions in the consolidated financial statements for pending litigation when we determine that an unfavorable outcome is probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated . while we believe that our accruals for these matters are adequate , if the actual loss from a loss contingency is significantly different than the estimated loss , our results of operations may be over or understated . acquisitions on may 31 , 2002 , the company completed the acquisition of osca , a completion services ( pressure pumping ) , completion tools and completion fluids company based in lafayette , louisiana , with operations primarily in the u.s. gulf of mexico , brazil and venezuela for a total purchase price of $ 470.6 million . on june 24 , 2002 , the company completed a $ 9.1 million acquisition of the coiled tubing assets and business of maritima petroleo e engenharia , ltda ( maritima ) , a leading provider of coiled tubing services in brazil . see note 3 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding these acquisitions . on november 26 , 2003 , the company completed the acquisition of cajun tubular services , inc. ( cajun ) for a total purchase price of $ 8.1 million ( net of cash ) . cajun , located in lafayette , louisiana , provides tubular running , testing and torque monitoring services to the gulf of mexico market . this acquisition was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting . on december 2 , 2003 , the company acquired the assets and business of petro-drive , a division of grant prideco , inc. , for a total purchase price of $ 7 million . petro-drive , located in lafayette , louisiana , is a leading provider of hydraulic and diesel hammer services to the gulf of mexico market and select markets internationally . this acquisition was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting . 24 story_separator_special_tag fiscal 2003 compared to fiscal 2002. operating income for fiscal 2003 was $ 190.3 million , an increase of $ 1.2 million , or 0.6 % from fiscal 2002. operating income increased as a result of activity increases , market share increases , and labor and equipment efficiencies . these increases were mostly offset by a deterioration in prices received by the company for pressure pumping services compared to fiscal 2002. the decline resulting from our prices for pumping services occurred primarily in the first quarter of fiscal 2003 . 26 results for fiscal 2002 compared to fiscal 2001 revenue was $ 898.7 million , a decrease of $ 320.7 million , or 26 % compared to fiscal 2001. the decline was primarily due to decreased drilling and workover activity which declined 26 % , compared to fiscal 2001. in addition , prices for the company 's pressure pumping services in the u.s. market weakened in fiscal 2002. operating income was $ 189.1 million , a decrease of $ 236.0 million , or 55.5 % compared to fiscal 2001. the decrease was due primarily to decreased revenue resulting from the decline in drilling and workover activity , along with the corresponding decline in prices for the company 's products and services . the company 's average u.s. pricing declined approximately 7 % from fiscal 2001. also contributing to the decline was increased labor costs as a percentage of revenue and higher depreciation resulting from the u.s. fleet recapitalization initiative , a program which began in late 1998 to rebuild and upgrade the company 's core fleet of fracturing pumping units in the u.s. outlook the company 's management believes that average u.s. rig count for fiscal 2004 will be approximately 14 % higher than fiscal 2003 , essentially flat with current levels at approximately 1,100 rigs . international pressure pumping segment the international pressure pumping segment primarily provides stimulation and cementing services to the petroleum industry outside of the u.s. and mexico . stimulation services are designed to improve the flow of oil and natural gas from producing formations . cementing services consists of pumping a cement slurry into a well between the casing and the wellbore to isolate fluids that might otherwise damage the casing and or affect productivity , or that could migrate to different zones , during the drilling and completion phase of a well . see business included elsewhere in the company 's 2003 annual report on form 10-k for more information . results for fiscal 2003 compared to fiscal 2002 revenue for fiscal 2003 was $ 801.8 million , an increase of $ 89.2 million , or 13 % from fiscal 2002. in canada , revenues increased 29 % compared to fiscal 2002 with a corresponding 29 % increase in the average active drilling rigs in canada from fiscal 2002. during the first quarter of fiscal 2003 , the activity increase was primarily in shallow drilling areas of southern canada as warm weather delayed rig movement into the north , an area with historically higher revenue per job .

"to achieve these goals , we are focused on generating increased value from our investments in advanced technologies , improving utilization of existing assets , executing our balanced growth strategy and selectively growing our scale and scope through strategic investments . we are an industry leader in developing and commercializing advanced packaging and test technologies . we believe these advanced technology solutions provide substantial value to our customers , particularly in the mobile communications market , where growth generally outpaces the overall semiconductor industry . advanced packages are now the preferred choice in both the high-end and the mid-range segments of the smartphone market , which together account for a high portion of mobile phone semiconductor value . the demand for advanced packages is also being driven by second-wave mobile device customers , who are transitioning out of wirebond into wafer-level and flip-chip packages . interest in advanced packages for automotive applications is growing as well , largely due to new , data-intensive applications , which require increased pin count and performance . we believe that our technology leadership and this technology transition create significant growth opportunities for us . we typically look for opportunities in the advanced packaging and test area where we can generate reasonably quick returns on investments made for customers seeking leading edge technologies . we also focus on developing a second wave of customers to fill the capacity that becomes available when leading edge customers transition to newer packaging and test equipment and platforms . in addition , we are seeking to add new customers and to deepen our engagement with existing customers . this includes an expanded emphasis on the automotive end market where semiconductor content continues to grow and in the analog area for our mainstream wirebond technologies . from time to time , we identify attractive opportunities to grow our customer base and expand the markets we serve through joint ventures , acquisitions and other strategic investments . for example , in may 2017 we acquired nanium , which has strengthened our position in the market for wafer-level fan-out packaging . we believe that taking advantage of these opportunities helps to diversify our revenue streams , improve our profits , broaden our portfolio of services and maintain our technological leadership . as a supplier in the semiconductor industry , our business is cyclical and impacted by broad economic factors . historical trends indicate there has been a strong correlation between worldwide gross domestic product levels , consumer spending and semiconductor industry cycles . the semiconductor industry has experienced significant and sometimes prolonged cyclical upturns and downturns in the past . we can not predict the timing , strength or duration of any correction , economic slowdown or subsequent economic recovery . while customer demand for our services was , overall , quite strong throughout 2020 , particularly in the communications and consumer end markets , demand in automotive and industrial was lower through most of the year due to the covid-19 pandemic . we made many adjustments to our operations during 2020 to navigate through the onset of the pandemic , and through these efforts we were able to continue serving customers and grow the business in a challenging environment . 36 the full potential effect of the covid-19 pandemic is unknown , and there is significant uncertainty related to the ultimate impact that the covid-19 pandemic will have on the global economy , our business , results of operations and financial condition . see part i , item 1a , including , “ the covid-19 outbreak has impacted and may continue to impact the supply chain and consumer demand for our customers ' products and services , which may adversely affect our business , results of operations , and financial condition ” and “ dependence on the highly cyclical semiconductor industry - our packaging and test services are used in volatile industries and industry downturns , and declines in global economic and financial conditions could harm our performance. ” we operate in a capital intensive industry . servicing our current and future customers requires that we incur significant operating expenses and continue to make significant capital expenditures , which are generally made in advance of the related revenues and without firm customer commitments . we fund our operations , including capital expenditures and debt service requirements , with cash flows from operations , existing cash and cash equivalents , short-term investments , borrowings under available credit facilities and proceeds from any additional financing . maintaining an appropriate level of liquidity is important to our business and depends on , among other considerations , the performance of our business , our capital expenditure levels , our ability to repay debt out of our operating cash flows or proceeds from debt or equity financings and our investment strategy . as of december 31 , 2020 , we had cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments of $ 698.0 million and $ 133.8 million , respectively . our net sales , gross profit , operating income , cash flows , liquidity

other debt agreements , market conditions and other factors . our subsidiary in korea maintains an unfunded severance plan that covers certain employees that were employed prior to august 1 , 2015. as of december 31 , 2020 , the severance liability was $ 98.0 million . accrued severance benefits are estimated assuming all eligible employees were to terminate their employment at the balance sheet date . for service periods subsequent to august 1 , 2015 , employees participate in either a defined benefit pension plan or a defined contribution pension plan . from time to time , we may offer employees the option to convert from the severance plan to the defined contribution plan which would require the company to fund the converted portion of the liability . we refer you to note 12 to our consolidated financial statements in part ii , item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k for additional information . in october 2020 , our board of directors approved the initiation of a regular

2021 to stockholders of record as of december 18 , 2020. we currently anticipate that we will continue to pay quarterly cash dividends in the future . however , the payment , amount and timing of future dividends remain within the discretion of our board of directors and will depend upon our results of operations , financial condition , cash requirements , debt restrictions and other factors . our board of directors previously authorized the repurchase of up to $ 300.0 million of our common stock , exclusive of any fees , commissions or other expenses . at december 31 , 2020 , approximately $ 91.6 million was available to repurchase common stock pursuant to the stock repurchase program . the purchase of stock may be made in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions . the timing , manner , price and amount of any repurchases will be determined by us at our discretion and will depend upon a variety of factors including economic and market conditions , the cash needs and investment opportunities for the business , the current market price of our stock , applicable legal requirements and other factors . we have not purchased any stock under the program since 2012 . 41 capital resources we make significant capital expenditures in order to service the demand of our customers , which are primarily focused on investments in advanced packaging and test equipment . in 2020 , our capital expenditures totaled $ 553.0 million or approximately 10.9 % of net sales . we expect that our 2021 capital expenditures will be approximately $ 700 million . ultimately , the amount of our 2021 capital expenditures will depend on several factors including , among others , the timing and implementation of any capital projects under review , the performance of our business , economic and market conditions , the cash needs and investment opportunities for the business , the need for additional capacity to service anticipated customer demand and the availability of cash flows from operations or financing . in addition , we are subject to risks associated with our capital expenditures , including those discussed in part i , item 1a of this annual report on form 10-k

performance or other events . these forward looking statements are based on our expectations and beliefs concerning future events affecting us . they are subject to uncertainties and factors relating to our operations and business environment , all of which are difficult to predict and many of which are beyond our control . although we believe that the expectations reflected in our forward looking statements are reasonable , we do not know whether our expectations will prove correct . they can be affected by inaccurate assumptions we might make or by known or unknown risks and uncertainties . general we are one of the leading manufacturers and suppliers of class rings , yearbooks , graduation products , achievement publications and recognition products and affinity jewelry in the united states . we market and sell yearbooks to the college , high school , junior high school and elementary markets . we primarily sell our class rings and graduation products , which include fine paper products and graduation accessories , in the high school , college and junior high school markets . our achievement publications segment produces , markets and sells publications that recognize the achievements of top students at the high school and college levels , as well as the nation 's most inspiring teachers . it consists of various titles including the who 's who brand and the national dean 's list . we also sell jewelry commemorating family events such as the birth of a child , military and fan affinity jewelry and related products , professional sports championship rings such as world series rings , commercial printing , and letter jackets . as fully described under the “ significant developments ” section of management 's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations , on october 26 , 2007 , the company decided to shut down the operations of its achievement publications segment . the shutdown activities are expected to be substantially complete by the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2008. our ability to meet our debt service and other obligations depends in significant part on how successful we are in maintaining our core businesses and further implementing our business strategy . our business plan envisions several long-term growth initiatives , including the development of new products . the components of our strategy are subject to significant business , economic and competitive uncertainties and contingencies . numerous raw materials are used in the manufacture of our products . gold and other metals , precious , semiprecious and synthetic stones , paper products and ink comprise the bulk of the raw materials we utilize in the largest segments of our business . prices of these materials , especially gold , continually fluctuate . we purchase a majority of our gold from a single supplier , the bank of nova scotia , through our existing gold consignment agreement . we may consign a portion of our gold and pay for gold as our products are shipped to customers . we also purchase the majority of our semi-precious and synthetic stones from a single supplier in germany . the prices for these products are denominated in euros . we generally are able to pass on price increases in gold and stones to our customers as such increases are realized by us , however , this may not always be the case . we face competition for most of our principal products . the class ring and yearbook markets are highly concentrated and consist primarily of a few national manufacturers ( of which we are one ) and , to a significantly lesser extent , small regional competitors . we believe that it would be costly and time-consuming for new competitors to replicate the production and distribution capabilities necessary to compete effectively in this market , and as a result , there have been no major new competitors in the last 61 years . 21 we experience seasonal fluctuations in our net sales tied primarily to the school year . we recorded 46 % of our fiscal year 2007 net sales in our third quarter . class ring sales are highest during october through december and early spring , with many orders made for delivery to students before the winter holiday season . graduation product sales are predominantly made during february through april prior to the april through june graduation season . yearbook sales are highest during the months of april through june , as yearbooks are typically shipped prior to each school 's summer break . our recognition and affinity product line sales are seasonal . the majority of our achievement publications are shipped in august of each year . the remaining recognition and affinity product line sales are highest during the winter holiday season and in the period leading up to mother 's day . we have experienced operating losses during our first and fourth fiscal quarters , which includes the beginning of the school year and the summer months when school is not in session , thus reducing related shipment of products . in addition , our working capital requirements tend to exceed our operating cash flows from may through september . we also have exposure to market risk relating to changes in interest rates on our variable rate debt . our senior secured credit facility ( revolver and term loan ) and existing gold consignment agreement are variable rate arrangements . story_separator_special_tag as a result of the foregoing recapitalization , intermediate holdings became a wholly owned subsidiary of parent holdings . on june 12 , 2006 , parent holdings issued $ 150.0 million principal amount of senior pik notes due october 1 , 2012. the net proceeds of this offering were used to pay a $ 140.5 million dividend to the stockholders of parent holdings . because ebitda fell below certain target levels for the four quarters ended february 24 , 2007 , the rate at which interest accrues on the senior pik notes was increased by 2.00 % per annum , to a rate of 14.75 % , commencing on and including february 24 , 2007. if the consolidated group leverage ratio on august 30 , 2008 , is greater than 5.0 to 1.0 , the rate at which interest accrues on the senior pik notes will increase an additional 2.00 % per annum commencing on and including august 30 , 2008. at august 25 , 2007 , our consolidated group leverage ratio was 7.6. the senior pik notes are the unsecured senior obligation of parent holdings and are not guaranteed by intermediate holdings or any of its subsidiaries . other than the series a preferred stock , debt obligations , related deferred debt issuance costs , associated accrued liabilities and related interest expense , net of taxes , all other assets , liabilities , income , expenses and cash flows presented for all periods represent those of parent holdings and intermediate holdings ' wholly-owned indirect subsidiary aac and the direct and indirect subsidiaries of aac . intermediate holdings ' only direct subsidiary is aac holding corp. , whose sole asset is the stock of aac . aac , intermediate holdings and parent holdings are treated as entities under common control . 23 critical accounting policies we prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america . as such , we are required to make certain estimates , judgments and assumptions that we believe are reasonable based upon the information available . these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented . the significant accounting policies which we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results include the following : sales returns and allowances . we make estimates of potential future product returns related to current period product revenue . we analyze the previous 12 months ' average historical returns , current economic trends and changes in customer demand and acceptance of our products when evaluating the adequacy of the sales returns and allowances . significant management judgments and estimates must be made and used in connection with establishing the allowance for sales returns and allowances in any accounting period . product returns as a percentage of net sales were 2.3 % , 2.0 % and 1.9 % for the fiscal years 2007 , 2006 and 2005 , respectively . a ten percent increase in product returns would result in a reduction of annual net sales of approximately $ 0.7 million , based on fiscal year end 2007 rates . material differences could result in the amount and timing of our revenue for any period if we made different judgments or utilized different estimates . allowance for doubtful accounts and reserve on independent sales representative advances . we make estimates of potentially uncollectible customer accounts receivable and receivables arising from independent sales representative advances paid in excess of earned commissions . our reserves are based on an analysis of individual customer and salesperson accounts and historical write-off experience . our analysis includes the age of the receivable , customer or salesperson creditworthiness and general economic conditions . write-offs of doubtful accounts as a percentage of net sales were 0.4 % , 0.3 % and 0.4 % for the fiscal years 2007 , 2006 and 2005 , respectively . write-offs of independent sales representative advances as a percentage of net sales were 0.6 % , 0.7 % and 0.5 % for the fiscal years ended 2007 , 2006 and 2005 , respectively . a ten percent increase in write-offs of doubtful accounts and independent sales representative advances would result in an increase in expense of approximately $ 0.1 million and $ 0.2 million , respectively , based on fiscal year ended 2007 rates . we believe that our results could be materially different if historical trends do not reflect actual results or if economic conditions worsened . goodwill and other intangible assets . we account for our long-lived assets with indefinite lives under statement of financial accounting standards ( “ sfas ” ) 142 , “ goodwill and other intangible assets ” ( “ sfas 142 ” ) . under sfas 142 we are required to test goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives for impairment annually , or more frequently if impairment indicators occur . the impairment test requires management to make judgments in connection with identifying reporting units , assigning assets and liabilities to reporting units and determining fair value of each reporting unit . significant judgments required to estimate the fair value of reporting units include projecting future cash flows , determining appropriate discount rates and other assumptions . the projections are based on historical performance and future estimated results . as of august 25 , 2007 , a third party valuation , among other factors , was used by management in our impairment analysis of other intangible assets values and the residual goodwill . as fully described under “ significant developments ” below , during fiscal 2007 we recorded an impairment of our goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives of $ 26.8 million , related to three of our reporting units . we believe that we had no other impairment as of august 25 , 2007 and august 26 , 2006 ; however , unforeseen future events could adversely affect the reported value of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets .
","results of operations the comparative results are presented and discussed for parent holdings , intermediate holdings , and aac for fiscal years 2007 , 2006 and 2005. replace_table_token_8_th replace_table_token_9_th replace_table_token_10_th 27 fiscal year ended august 25 , 2007 compared to fiscal year ended august 26 , 2006 net sales . net sales consist of product sales and are net of product returns and promotional discounts . net sales decreased $ 5.2 million , or 1.6 % , to $ 315.7 million in fiscal 2007 from $ 320.9 million in fiscal 2006. the decrease was primarily attributable to lower sales in achievement publications and retail class rings , partially offset by stronger sales of on-campus class rings , personalized family jewelry , commercial printing , graduation products , yearbooks , and sales of letter jackets attributed to the acquisition of powers in april 2007. class rings . net sales increased $ 1.5 million to $ 120.9 million in fiscal 2007 from $ 119.4 million in fiscal 2006. the increase in net sales from class rings was the result of a $ 4.2 million increase in on-campus class ring sales , partially offset by a decline of $ 2.7 million in retail high school class ring sales . the increase in on-campus class ring sales was primarily due to price increases , new products and improved sales of championship rings . these increases were partially offset by a volume decrease due to a number of schools starting one or two weeks later in 2007 than in 2006 and the change in product sales mix caused by continuing increases in gold prices , causing buyers to purchase lower priced non-gold rings . the decline in retail sales of high school class rings was driven by the continuing softness in the retail jewelry market , the declining number of independent jewelers and the change in product mix . yearbooks .

"when we use the term “ constant currency , ” it means that we have translated financial data for a period into united states dollars using the same foreign currency exchange rates that we used to translate financial data for the previous period . we believe that this calculation is a useful measure , indicating the actual growth of our operations . we use constant currency results in our analysis of subsidiary or segment performance . we also use constant currency when analyzing our performance against that of our competitors . substantially all of our subsidiaries derive revenues and incur expenses within a single country and , consequently , do not generally incur currency risks in connection with the conduct of their normal business operations . changes in foreign currency exchange rates primarily impact reported earnings and not our actual cash flow unless earnings are repatriated . when we use the term “ organic constant currency , ” it means that we have further removed the impact of acquisitions in the current period and dispositions from the prior period from our constant currency calculation . we believe that this calculation is useful because it allows us to show the actual growth of our ongoing business . the constant currency and organic constant currency financial measures are used to supplement those measures that are in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles ( “ gaap ” ) . these non-gaap financial measures may not provide information that is directly comparable to that provided by other companies in our industry , as other companies may calculate such financial results differently . these non-gaap financial measures are not measurements of financial performance under gaap , and should not be considered as alternatives to measures presented in accordance with gaap . constant currency and organic constant currency percent variances , along with a reconciliation of these amounts to certain of our reported results , are included on page 37. results of operations - for years of operation ending december 31 , 2019 and 2018 the financial discussion that follows focuses on 2019 results compared to 2018. for a discussion of 2018 results compared to 2017 , see the company 's annual report on form 10-k for the year ended december 31 , 2018 . during 2019 , the united states dollar was stronger , on average , relative to the currencies in the majority of our markets than in 2018 , and subsequently was having an unfavorable impact on our reported results . this strengthening was particularly pronounced against the euro and british pound . our reported revenues from services decreased 5.1 % in 2019 compared to 2018 and our reported operating profit decreased 19.1 % . given the relative weakness of other currencies against the united states dollar in 2019 compared to the 2018 , these results generally may understate the performance of our underlying business . the changes in the foreign currency exchange rates had a 4.2 % unfavorable impact on revenues from services , a 3.5 % unfavorable impact on operating profit , and an approximately $ 0.28 per share unfavorable impact on net earnings per share - diluted . substantially all of our subsidiaries derive revenues from services and incur expenses within the same currency and generally do not have cross-currency transactions , and therefore , changes in foreign currency exchange rates primarily impact reported earnings and not our actual cash flow unless earnings are repatriated . to understand the performance of our underlying business , we utilize constant currency or organic constant currency variances for our consolidated and segment results . 29 in 2019 , the environment has been one of revenue declines in most of our european markets , with slow ing economic growth globally and continued tight labor markets in many countries that has overshadow ed modest constant currency growth elsewhere . over the course of the year , we experienced the following changes to o ur consolidated revenues : first quarter constant currency revenue decrease of 2.2 % , 0.1 % decrease in constant currency in the second quarter , 0.3 % constant currency increase in the third quarter , with a deterioration in the fourth quarter to a 1.8 % constant currency decrease . we remain highly focused on our business in europe , where southern and northern europe segments combined reflect 66 % of our total consolidated revenues . in 2019 , several key markets within southern and northern europe experienced revenue declines , partially offset by constant currency revenue increases in certain markets within the americas and apme . we experienced a revenue decline in organic constant currency in southern europe due to the revenue decline s in france and italy , partially offset by organic constant currency revenue growth in certain markets within other southern europe . the revenue decrease in northern europe was primarily due to the decrease s in germany , the netherlands , and sweden due mostly to reduced demand from the manufacturing sector in those markets and uncertainties related to global trade conflicts . in the americas , revenues increased 3.6 % in constant currency due to increased demand for our staffing/interim services in certain markets within other americas and an increase in our manpowergroup solutions business . these increases were partially offset by a slight decrease in the united states primarily driven by a decline in demand for our staffing/interim due to the challenging manufacturing environment . our gross profit margin in 2019 decreased compared to 2018 primarily due to the decreased margins in our higher-margin manpowergroup solutions business , particularly within our talent based outsourcing business , partially offset by a favorable impact from changes in currency exchange rates . our operating profit decreased 19.1 % in 2019 ( -15.6 % in constant currency and -14.4 % in organic constant currency ) while our operating profit margin decreased 50 basis points compared to 2018. included in 2019 and 2018 were $ 39.8 million and $ 39.3 million , respectively , of restructuring costs . story_separator_special_tag 32 we recorded income tax expense at an effective rate of 32.1 % in 2019 , as compared to an effective rate of 26.2 % in 2018. the 2019 rate was unfavorably impacted by the transition of the french cice subsidy , which was non-taxable , to new french subsidies in january 2019 that are taxable , and the recognition of a valuation allowance in germany . these items were partially offset by a one-time tax benefit related to the refinancing of an intercompan y lending arrangement . the 32.1 % effective tax rate for 2019 was higher than the united states federal statutory rate of 21 % due primarily to the french business tax , our overall mix of earnings , and the recognition of a valuation allowance in germany . in 2020 , we expect our effective tax rate to increase to approximately 34 % due primarily to the exclusion of the one-time tax benefit related to the refinancing of an intercompany lending arrangement . net earnings per share - diluted was $ 7.72 in 2019 compared to $ 8.56 in 2018. foreign currency exchange rates favorably impacted net earnings per share - diluted by approximately $ 0.28 in 2019. the gain from the acquisition of manpower switzerland recorded in 2019 positively impacted net earnings per share - diluted by approximately $ 1.32 per share . goodwill impairment and related tax and other charges recorded in 2019 negatively impacted net earnings per share - diluted by approximately $ 1.26. the gain from the deconsolidation recorded in 2019 positively impacted net earnings per share - diluted by approximately $ 0.50 per share . in 2019 and 2018 , restructuring costs negatively impacted net earnings per share - diluted by approximately $ 0.52 and $ 0.46 per share , net of tax . the gain from the sale of the netherlands ' language translation business favorably impacted net earnings per share - diluted by approximately $ 0.06 per share , net of tax , for 2018. weighted average shares - diluted decreased 7.3 % to 60.3 million in 2019 from 65.1 million in 2018. this decrease was due to the impact of share repurchases completed in 2019 and the full weighting of the repurchases completed in 2018 , partially offset by shares issued as a result of exercises and vesting of share-based awards in 2019. segment results we evaluate performance based on operating unit profit ( “ oup ” ) , which is equal to segment revenues less direct costs and branch and national headquarters operating costs . this profit measure does not include goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges or amortization of intangible assets related to acquisitions , corporate expenses , interest and other income and expense amounts or income taxes . effective january 2020 , our segment reporting was realigned due to our right management business being combined with each of our respective country business units . accordingly , our former reportable segment , right management , is now reported within each of our respective reportable segments . we will report on the new realigned segments beginning in the first quarter of 2020. all previously reported results will be restated to conform to the new presentation . americas in the americas , revenues from services increased 0.6 % ( 3.6 % in constant currency and 3.1 % in organic constant currency ) in 2019 compared to 2018. in the united states , revenues from services decreased 0.6 % ( -1.4 % on an organic basis ) in 2019 compared to 2018 , primarily driven by a decline in demand for our staffing/interim services in a challenging manufacturing environment , partially offset by a 5.2 % increase in our permanent recruitment business , an increase in our manpowergroup solutions business , primarily within our msp offering , and the additional revenues as a result of franchise acquisitions in august and october 2019. in other americas , revenues from services increased 2.3 % ( 10.0 % in constant currency ) in 2019 compared to 2018. we experienced revenue growth in mexico , canada , and peru of 2.2 % , 13.7 % , and 17.3 % , respectively ( 2.4 % , 16.3 % , and 19.0 % , respectively , in constant currency ) . these increases were partially offset by decreases in argentina , colombia and brazil of 28.8 % , 2.3 % and 5.6 % , respectively ( increases of 26.0 % , 8.5 % and 2.5 % , respectively , in constant currency ) . the constant currency increase in argentina was primarily due to inflation . there has been a steady devaluation of the argentine peso relative to the united states dollar in the last few years . as of july 1 , 2018 , the argentina economy was designated as highly-inflationary and was treated as such for accounting purposes starting in the third quarter of 2018 . 33 gross profit margin was flat for 2019 compared to 2018 . we experienced an increase in our united states staffing/interim margin due to pricing discipline and lower payroll tax and insurance costs . gross profit margin also increased due to the increase of 4.8 % ( 6.2 % in constant currency and 5.9 % in organic constant currency ) in the permanent recruitment business in 2019 compared to 2018. the gross profit margin increases in 2019 compared to 2018 were offset by the decreases in the staffing/interim gross profit margins within certain markets within other americas . in 2019 , selling and administrative expenses increased 3.8 % ( 6.3 % in constant currency ; 5.8 % in organic constant currency ) , due primarily to an increase in salary-related expenses , as a result of higher headcount related to growth initiatives , and an increase in restructuring costs to $ 5.1 million in 2019 from $ 0.3 million in 2018. oup margin in the americas was 4.5 % and 4.9 % for 2019 and 2018 , respectively . in the united states , oup margin was 4.5 % and 5.2 % in 2019 and 2018 , respectively .
","consolidated results - 2019 compared to 2018 the following table presents selected consolidated financial data for 2019 as compared to 2018. replace_table_token_4_th the year-over-year decrease in revenues from services of 5.1 % ( -0.9 % in constant currency and -1.0 % in organic constant currency ) was attributed to : decreased demand for services in several of our markets within northern europe , where revenues decreased 12.6 % ( -7.6 % in constant currency and -6.8 % in organic constant currency ) , primarily due to reduced demand for our manpower staffing services due to low levels of manufacturing activity and uncertainties related to global trade conflicts , and the disposition of our language translation business in the netherlands at the end of december 2018. we experienced revenue declines in germany , the netherlands , belgium , the united kingdom , and the nordics of 25.2 % , 24.7 % , 10.2 % , 4.4 % , and 10.1 % ( -21.1 % , -20.5 % , -5.3 % , -0.1 % , and -2.6 % , respectively , in constant currency ; -16.7 % and -1.4 % in organic constant currency in the netherlands and the nordics , respectively ) ; a revenue decrease in southern europe of 2.2 % ( increase of 2.8 % in constant currency ; -0.8 % in organic constant currency ) .

"investors should consult all of the information set forth in this report and the other information set forth from time to time in our reports filed with the securities and exchange commission pursuant to the securities act of 1933 and the securities exchange act of 1934 , including our reports on forms 10-q and 8-k. the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in item 8 of this annual report . overview we offer a state-of-the-art digital publishing platform . we use this platform to power our consumer-facing mobile personalization app , called zedge , available in the google play store and app store , which offers an easy , entertaining and immersive way for end-users to engage with our rich and diverse catalogue of wallpapers , video wallpapers , ringtones , notification sounds on android and wallpapers , video wallpapers and ringtones , on ios . we secure our content from amateur and professional artists , and also from emerging and major brands . artists have the ability to easily launch a virtual storefront in our zedge app where they can market and sell their content to our user base . in fiscal 2020 , we introduced a new entertainment app called “ shortz – chat stories by zedge ” , which is focused on serialized , short-form , fiction stories , as a beta that runs on our publishing platform . our zedge app has been installed approximately 450 million times , and at july 31 , 2020 , boasted approximately 32 million monthly active users , or mau . mau is a key performance indicator that captures the number of unique users that used our zedge app during the previous 30-day of the relevant period . our zedge app has consistently ranked as one of the most popular free apps in the google play store in the united states . historically , we have not made a material investment in paid user acquisition for our zedge app . our zedge app 's success stems from its ability to meet consumer demand for a rich and diverse catalogue of both long-tail and popular content in a fun , intuitive and user-friendly fashion that aligns with their interest in expressing their essence in a bespoke manner , to offer reliable search and discovery capabilities and to make relevant content recommendations to our users . to this end , we invest heavily in both product design and development and the underlying technology required to satisfy both our zedge app 's users ' and content contributors ' expectations . our zedge app utilizes both user-generated and licensed , third-party content to achieve these goals . in march 2018 , we launched zedge premium , a marketplace within our zedge app where professional creators and brands market , distribute and sell their digital content to our consumers . since launching zedge premium , we have made and continue making material investments in optimizing our zedge app 's homepage design in order to maximize exposure to premium content with the goal of driving sales . over time , we expect that zedge premium will contribute to a virtuous cycle whereby it drives new consumers into our zedge app resulting in more artist payouts , which in turn makes the platform more attractive for artists and brands looking to expand their reach and increase their income . in january 2019 , we started offering freemium zedge app users the ability to convert into paying subscribers for amongst other things the ability to remove unsolicited advertisements from our zedge app . as of july 31 , 2020 , we had more than 504,000 active paid subscribers . in fiscal 2021 , we hope to further optimize the offer based on user type , geography and price point as well as introduce new subscription enhancements like content bundles and rewards . in december 2019 , we completed the beta launch of 'shortz ' our new entertainment app offering serialized , short-form fiction delivered in a text-message format across both android and ios , focusing on users in the united states , the united kingdom and canada and it is now available globally . over the past several years , our zedge app has experienced a continuing decline in its mau as well as a shift in the regional customer make-up with mau in emerging markets representing an increasing portion of our user base . as of july 31 , 2020 , users in emerging markets represented 70 % of our mau compared to 65 % a year prior . this shift has negatively impacted revenue because advertising rates in emerging markets are materially lower than in well-developed markets . in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 , users in emerging markets grew by 1.4 % while users in well-developed economies declined 18.6 % when compared to the same period in fiscal 2019. as of july 31 , 2020 , approximately 50 % of our zedge app 's user base was located in north america and europe ( including eastern europe ) with a split of 26 % and 24 % , respectively , compared with 54 % as of july 31 , 2019 with 27 % in each of north america and europe ( including eastern europe ) . mau growth is tightly coupled with securing new users . historically , our relatively high ranking in the google play store has been one of the primary drivers for securing new users . although still an important factor , we now also dedicate resources to growth initiatives , both organic and paid . with time , we believe that we can change our growth dynamic in well-developed markets . aside from targeted growth initiatives , we need to continually improve the core user experience , test different mechanisms and content verticals that may spur growth and capitalize on the role that zedge premium artists can have on driving new users into the zedge platform . 24 the covid-19 pandemic has negatively impacted our zedge app 's new user growth . story_separator_special_tag however , upgrades and enhancements , defined as modifications to existing internal-use software that result in additional functionality ( modifications to enable the software to perform tasks that it was previously incapable of performing , normally requiring new software specifications and perhaps a change to all or part of the existing software specifications ) are treated as though they were new projects , and are assessed utilizing the same stages and criteria on a project by project basis . as such , internal costs incurred for upgrades and enhancements are expensed or capitalized based on the requirements noted above , while costs incurred for maintenance are expensed as incurred . these projects are tracked individually , such that the beginning and ending of the capitalization can be appropriately established , as well as the amounts capitalized therein . amortization of these costs is included in depreciation and amortization in the statement of comprehensive loss . revenue recognition on august 1 , 2018 , we adopted financial accounting standards board accounting standards codification topic 606 , applying the modified retrospective method to those contracts not yet substantially completed as of august 1 , 2018. the impact of adopting the new revenue standard was not material to our consolidated financial statements and there was no adjustment to beginning retained earnings on august 1 , 2018. we generate revenue from four sources : ( 1 ) advertising ; ( 2 ) paid subscriptions ; ( 3 ) zedge premium and other and ( 4 ) service . the substantial majority of our revenue is generated from selling our advertising inventory ( “ advertising revenue ” ) to advertising networks and advertising exchanges , and through direct arrangements with advertisers . our monthly and annual subscriptions allow users to prepay a fixed fee to remove unsolicited advertisements from our android zedge app although we are working on adding additional capabilities to subscriptions including offering subscriptions to ios zedge app users . in zedge premium , we retain 30 % as fee when users purchase licensed content using zedge credits or unlock licensed content by watching a video or taking a survey on zedge premium . in fiscal 2019 , we also generated revenue from managing and optimizing the advertising inventory of a third-party mobile application publisher , as well as overseeing the billing , collections and reporting related to advertising for this publisher ( “ service revenue ” ) . the contract with this publisher was terminated effective may 31 , 2019. advertising revenue : we generates the bulk of our revenue from selling our zedge app 's advertising inventory to advertising networks and advertising exchanges and direct sales to advertisers . we also generate revenue from app publishers that pay us for installations of their apps . ● advertising networks . an advertising network is a third-party relationship where buyers of advertising inventory go to purchase either specific targeted inventory or a large scale of inventory at a set price . advertising networks serve as an indirect source of advertising fill to a variety of branded ad campaigns and performance-based ad campaigns . ● advertising exchanges . an advertising exchange is similar to an advertising network , except that the exchange typically bids in real-time for inventory . advertisers may utilize an exchange when looking for scale or specific audiences , and accept that the price will vary based on when and how much volume of inventory they wish to buy . ● direct sales to advertisers . we sell advertising directly to advertisers through a contractual relationship . these relationships typically offer higher than average pricing than realized from sales via advertising networks or advertising exchanges . ● app installs . we earn revenue when a zedge user installs an app offered by a publisher in the game channel that pays the company a pre-negotiated fee for the installation ( referred to as cost per install or cpi ) . in october 2018 , the company replaced the game channel with a game wall which offers zedge users with a mix of interactive playable ads and html5 games which , if installed by the user , generate revenue for zedge . the company discontinued game wall in the second quarter of fiscal 2020 . 26 we recognize advertising revenue as advertisements are delivered to users through impressions , ad views or app installs ( depending on the terms agreed upon with the advertiser ) . for in-app display ads , in-app offers , engagement advertisements and other advertisements , our performance obligation is satisfied over the life of the relevant contract ( i.e. , over time ) , with revenue being recognized as advertising units are delivered . the advertiser may compensate us on a cost-per-impression , cost-per-click , cost-per-action or cost-per-install basis . paid subscription revenue : beginning in january 2019 , we started offering monthly and annual paid subscription services sold through google play . when a customer subscribes

business . investment income was $ 21.8 million in 2015 compared to $ 22.3 million in 2014. the lower investment income in 2015 was primarily due to the effects of translating weaker foreign currencies to the u.s. dollar , partially offset by higher realized gains and average portfolio balances . income taxes the 2015 effective income tax rate of 31.4 % decreased from 32.7 % in 2014. the decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily due to an increase in research tax credits in 2015. replace_table_token_14_th the company 's worldwide truck net sales and revenues increased to $

declared a $ 0.07 per share cash dividend , payable november 28 , 2016 to shareholders of record on november 18 , 2016 , representing a 40 % increase when compared to the last quarter . the primary measures we use to evaluate and manage our financial results are set forth in the table below . story_separator_special_tag when these assets are evaluated for impairment , if the carrying amount exceeds fair value , an impairment charge is recorded to income . the fair value is based on observable market prices , when practicable . other valuation techniques may be used when market prices are unavailable , including estimated discounted cash flows . this type of analysis contains uncertainties because it requires management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate industry economic factors and the profitability of future business strategies . in the event of future changes in fair value , the company may be exposed to an impairment charge that could be material . 41 allowance for loan losses determining an appropriate level of allowance for loan losses involves a high degree of judgment . we use a methodology to systematically measure the amount of estimated loan loss exposure inherent in the loan portfolio for purposes of establishing a sufficient allowance for loan losses . the methodology includes elements for specific reserves on impaired loans and loss allocations for non-impaired loans : loss allocations are identified for individual loans deemed to be impaired in accordance with gaap . impaired loans are loans for which it is probable that the bank will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreements , including non-accrual loans and all loans restructured in a troubled debt restructuring . impaired loans do not include large groups of smaller-balance homogeneous loans that are collectively evaluated for impairment , which consist of most residential mortgage loans and consumer loans . impairment is measured on a discounted cash flow method based upon the loan 's contractual effective interest rate , or at the loan 's observable market price , or if the loan is collateral dependent , at the fair value of the collateral less costs to sell . for collateral dependent loans , management may adjust appraised values to reflect estimated market value declines or apply other discounts to appraised values for unobservable factors resulting from its knowledge of circumstances associated with the property . loss allocations for non-impaired loans are based on historical charge-offs adjusted for qualitative factors . qualitative factors include , but are not limited to , risk ratings , delinquency levels , the value of underlying collateral , concentrations of credit , current economic conditions , the state of the business cycle and competitive and regulatory issues . loss allocations for non-impaired commercial loans and commercial mortgage loans are based on an internal rating system and the application of loss allocation factors . the loan rating system is described under the caption “ credit quality indicators ” in note 6 of the notes to consolidated financial statements . the loan rating system and the related loss allocation factors take into consideration parameters including the borrower 's financial condition , the borrower 's performance with respect to loan terms , and the adequacy of collateral . the loss allocation factors also take into account general and regional economic statistics , trends , and portfolio characteristics such as age of portfolio and the bank 's experience with a particular loan product . we periodically reassess and revise the loss allocation factors used in the assignment of loss exposure to appropriately reflect our analysis of migrational loss experience . portfolios of residential mortgages and consumer loans are assigned loss allocations as groups taking into account delinquency ratios and other indicators and our historical loss experience for each type of credit product . we analyze historical loss experience over periods deemed to be relevant to the inherent risk of loss in loan portfolios as of the balance sheet date . we periodically update these analyses and adjust the loss allocations for various factors that we believe are not adequately presented in historical loss experience including trends in real estate values , changes in unemployment levels and increases in delinquency levels . these factors are also evaluated taking into account the geographic location of the underlying loans . because the methodology is based upon peer bank data and trends , current economic data as well as management 's judgment , factors may arise that result in different estimations . adversely different conditions or assumptions could lead to increases in the allowance . in addition , various regulatory agencies periodically review the allowance for loans losses . such agencies may require additions to the allowance based on their judgments about information available to them at the time of their examination . as of december 31 , 2016 , management believes that the allowance is adequate and consistent with asset quality and delinquency indicators . stock-based compensation the company measures and recognizes compensation cost relating to share-based payment transactions based on the grant-date fair value of the equity instruments issued . the fair value of time-based restricted stock is recorded based on the grant date fair value of the company 's common stock . the fair value of market-based restricted stock is based on values derived using a monte carlo based pricing model . the fair value of stock options is determined using the black-sholes option pricing model . stock-based compensation costs are recognized over the requisite service period for the awards . compensation expense reflects the number of awards expected to vest and is adjusted based on awards that ultimately vest . 42 derivative instrument valuation the company enters into interest rate swap agreements as part of the company 's interest rate risk management strategy . management applies the hedge accounting provisions of accounting standards codification ( “ asc ” ) topic 815 , and formally documents at inception all relationships between hedging instruments and hedged items , as well as its risk management objectives and strategies for undertaking the various hedges . additionally , the company uses dollar offset or regression analysis at the hedge 's inception and for each reporting period thereafter , to assess whether the derivative used in its hedging transaction is expected to be and has been highly effective in offsetting changes in the fair value or cash flows of the hedged item .
","results of operations net interest income net interest income is the difference between interest earned on loans and securities and interest paid on deposits and other borrowings , and is the primary source of our operating income . net interest income is affected by the level of interest rates , changes in interest rates and changes in the amount and composition of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities . included in interest income are certain loan fees , such as deferred origination fees and late charges . we convert tax-exempt income to a fte basis using the statutory federal income tax rate adjusted for applicable state income taxes net of the related federal tax benefit . the average balances are principally daily averages . interest income on loans includes the effect of deferred loan fees and costs accounted for as yield adjustments . premium amortization and discount accretion are included in the respective interest income and interest expense amounts . year ended december 31 , 2016 compared to year ended december 31 , 2015 fte net interest income for the years ended december 31 , 2016 and 2015 was $ 49.7 million and $ 43.2 million , respectively . net interest income increased due to increases in earning assets offset by higher rates and volume on interest bearing deposits driven by promotional rate increases to remain competitive in the market place and the addition of $ 25.5 million of 5.75 % fixed rate subordinated debentures in august of 2015. fte basis interest income for the year ended december 31 , 2016 increased by $ 10.3 million to $ 61.6 million , or 20 % , compared to fte basis interest income for the year ended december 31 , 2015 due primarily to growth in interest earning assets , specifically , loan growth in our commercial real estate and commercial business portfolios .

"the continuing shift from an offline to online world has contributed to the growth of our business since inception , contributing to revenue growth , and we expect that this online shift will continue to benefit our business . users are increasingly using diverse devices and modalities to access our products and services , and our advertising revenues are increasingly coming from new formats . our users are accessing the internet via diverse devices and modalities , such as smartphones , wearables and smart home devices , and want to feel connected no matter where they are or what they are doing . we seek to expand our products and services to stay in front of these trends in order to maintain and grow our business . we generate our advertising revenues increasingly from different channels , including mobile , and newer advertising formats , and the margins from the advertising revenues from these channels and newer products have generally been lower than those from traditional desktop search . additionally , as the market for a particular device type or modality matures , our revenues may be affected . for example , growth in the global smartphone market has slowed due to various factors , including increased market saturation in developed countries , which can affect our mobile advertising revenue growth rates . we expect tac paid to our distribution partners and google network members to increase as our revenues grow and to be affected by changes in device mix ; geographic mix ; partner mix ; partner agreement terms ; the percentage of queries channeled through paid access points ; product mix ; the relative revenue growth rates of advertising revenues from different channels ; and revenue share terms . we expect these trends to continue to affect our revenue growth rates and put pressure on our overall margins . as online advertising evolves , we continue to expand our product offerings which may affect our monetization . as interactions between users and advertisers change and as online user behavior evolves , we continue to expand and evolve our product offerings to serve their changing needs . over time , we expect our monetization trends to fluctuate . for example , we have seen an increase in youtube ads and google play ads , which monetize at a lower rate than our traditional search ads . as users in developing economies increasingly come online , our revenues from international markets continue to increase and movements in foreign exchange rates affect such revenues . the shift to online , as well as the advent of the multi-device world , has brought opportunities outside of the u.s. , including in emerging markets , such as india , where we continue to invest heavily and develop localized versions of our products and relevant advertising programs useful to our users in these markets . this has led to a trend of increased revenues from international markets over time , as regions with emerging markets , such as apac , have demonstrated higher revenue growth rates . we expect that our results will continue to be affected by our performance in these markets , particularly as low-cost mobile devices become more available . this trend could impact our margins as developing markets initially monetize at a lower rate than more mature markets . our international revenues represent a significant portion of our revenues and are subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates relative to the u.s. dollar . while we have a foreign exchange risk management program designed to reduce our exposure to these fluctuations , this program does not fully offset their effect on our revenues and earnings . 30 alphabet inc. the portion of our revenues that we derive from non-advertising revenues is increasing and may affect margins . non-advertising revenues have grown over time . we expect this trend to continue as we focus on expanding our offerings to our users through products and services like google cloud , google play , hardware products , and youtube subscriptions . across these initiatives , we currently derive non-advertising revenues primarily from sales of apps , in-app purchases , digital content products , and hardware ; and licensing and service fees , including fees received for google cloud services and subscription and other services . the margins on these revenues vary significantly and may be lower than the margins on our advertising revenues . a number of our other bets initiatives are in their initial development stages , and as such , the sources of revenues from these businesses could change over time and the revenues could be volatile . as we continue to serve our users and expand our businesses , we will invest heavily in operating and capital expenditures . we continue to make significant r & d investments in areas of strategic focus such as advertising , cloud , machine learning , and search , as well as in new products and services . in addition , we expect to continue to invest in land and buildings for data centers and offices , and information technology assets , which includes servers and network equipment , to support the long-term growth of our business . in addition , acquisitions and strategic investments are an important part of our strategy and use of capital , contributing to the breadth and depth of our offerings , expanding our expertise in engineering and other functional areas , and building strong partnerships around strategic initiatives . for example , in 2020 we announced our google for india digitization fund to invest approximately $ 10 billion into india over the next 5-7 years through a mix of equity investments , partnerships , and operational , infrastructure and ecosystem investments . we face continuing changes in regulatory conditions , laws and public policies , which could impact our business practices and financial results . story_separator_special_tag revenues from the united states , emea , apac , and other americas were $ 85.0 billion , $ 55.4 billion , $ 32.6 billion , and $ 9.4 billion , respectively . total cost of revenues was $ 84.7 billion , an increase of 18 % year over year . tac was $ 32.8 billion , an increase of 9 % year over year , primarily driven by an increase in revenues subject to tac . other cost of revenues were $ 51.9 billion , an increase of 24 % year over year , primarily driven by an increase in data centers and other operations costs and content acquisition costs . 32 alphabet inc. operating expenses were $ 56.6 billion , an increase of 5 % year over year primarily driven by headcount growth and partially offset by declines in advertising and promotional expenses and travel and entertainment expenses . other information : operating cash flow was $ 65.1 billion . capital expenditures , which primarily included investments in technical infrastructure , were $ 22.3 billion . number of employees was 135,301 as of december 31 , 2020. the majority of new hires during the year were engineers and product managers . our segments beginning in the fourth quarter of 2020 , we report our segment results as google services , google cloud , and other bets : google services includes products and services such as ads , android , chrome , hardware , google maps , google play , search , and youtube . google services generates revenues primarily from advertising ; sales of apps , in-app purchases , digital content products , and hardware ; and fees received for subscription-based products such as youtube premium and youtube tv . google cloud includes google 's infrastructure and data analytics platforms , collaboration tools , and other services for enterprise customers . google cloud generates revenues primarily from fees received for google cloud platform ( `` gcp '' ) services and google workspace ( formerly known as g suite ) collaboration tools . other bets is a combination of multiple operating segments that are not individually material . revenues from the other bets are derived primarily through the sale of internet services as well as licensing and r & d services . unallocated corporate costs primarily include corporate initiatives , corporate shared costs , such as finance and legal , including fines and settlements , as well as costs associated with certain shared research and development activities . additionally , hedging gains ( losses ) related to revenue are included in corporate costs . story_separator_special_tag google other revenues google other revenues consist primarily of revenues from : google play , which includes revenues from sales of apps and in-app purchases ( which we recognize net of payout to developers ) and digital content sold in the google play store ; hardware , including google nest home products , pixelbooks , pixel phones and other devices ; youtube non-advertising , including youtube premium and youtube tv subscriptions and other services ; and other products and services . 35 alphabet inc. google other revenues increased $ 4,697 million from 2019 to 2020. the growth was primarily driven by google play and youtube non-advertising . growth for google play was primarily driven by sales of apps and in-app purchases , which benefited from elevated user engagement partially due to the impact of covid-19 . growth for youtube non-advertising was primarily driven by an increase in paid subscribers . over time , our growth rate for google other revenues may be affected by the seasonality associated with new product and service launches as well as market dynamics . google cloud our google cloud revenues increased $ 4,141 million from 2019 to 2020. the growth was primarily driven by gcp followed by our google workspace offerings . our infrastructure and our data and analytics platform products were the largest drivers of growth in gcp . over time , our growth rate for google cloud revenues may be affected by customer usage , market dynamics , as well as new product and service launches . revenues by geography the following table presents our revenues by geography as a percentage of revenues , determined based on the addresses of our customers : replace_table_token_8_th for further details on revenues by geography , see note 2 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in part ii , item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k. use of constant currency revenues and constant currency revenue percentage change the effect of currency exchange rates on our business is an important factor in understanding period to period comparisons . our international revenues are favorably affected as the u.s. dollar weakens relative to other foreign currencies , and unfavorably affected as the u.s. dollar strengthens relative to other foreign currencies . our revenues are also favorably affected by net hedging gains and unfavorably affected by net hedging losses . we use non-gaap constant currency revenues and non-gaap percentage change in constant currency revenues for financial and operational decision-making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons . we believe the presentation of results on a constant currency basis in addition to u.s. generally accepted accounting principles ( `` gaap '' ) results helps improve the ability to understand our performance because they exclude the effects of foreign currency volatility that are not indicative of our core operating results . constant currency information compares results between periods as if exchange rates had remained constant period over period . we define constant currency revenues as total revenues excluding the effect of foreign exchange rate movements and hedging activities , and use it to determine the constant currency revenue percentage change on a year-on-year basis . constant currency revenues are calculated by translating current period revenues using prior period exchange rates , as well as excluding any hedging effects realized in the current period .

corporate headquarters in north liberty , iowa . we provide nationwide transportation services to major shippers spanning from washington to florida and new england to california as well as parts of canada . we offer primarily asset-based transportation services in the dry van truckload market and also offer temperature-controlled transportation services and non asset-based freight brokerage services although such temperature-controlled and non asset-based services are not material sources of revenue . we provide these transportation services using predominately company-owned and leased revenue equipment . we also obtain additional capacity through the use of independent contractor tractors , although this source of capacity is not significant to our overall operations . we generally earn revenue based on the number of miles per load delivered . we believe the keys to success are maintaining high levels of customer service and safety . 21 management believes achieving high levels of customer service and safety is predicated on the availability of late-model equipment and experienced drivers . management believes that our service standards , safety record , and equipment availability have made us a core carrier for many of our major customers . we achieve operating efficiencies and cost controls through equipment utilization , which is optimized by a common information system platform , a fleet of late model equipment , industry-leading driver to non-driver employee ratio , and effective management of fixed and variable operating costs . the demand for freight services was moderate in 2013 and strong in 2014 as demand for freight services generally outpaced industry capacity in 2014 and into early 2015. the demand for freight services generally slowed in the later months of 2015 compared to 2014 levels . industry capacity continues to be hindered by an insufficient quantity of qualified drivers , which is further challenged by various regulations that reduce drivers ' availability . industry regulations , including the thirty minute break within the first eight hours of driving requirement that became effective july 1 , 2013 , have and will continue to reduce driver utilization compared to previous periods . further , conformity to the eld requirement will continue to reduce overall industry capacity and driver availability . we can not predict how future regulations will impact driver utilization . an industry shortage of qualified drivers , in conjunction with reduced driver utilization , creates a favorable rate environment , but also a general industry trend toward increased driver wages to attract and retain qualified drivers . we can not currently predict how long this volatility will continue or its future impact . competition for drivers , which has historically been intense , has recently escalated due to higher demand for freight services and decreasing numbers of qualified drivers in the industry , and we have experienced increased difficulties attracting and retaining qualified drivers . we continue to explore new strategies to attract and retain qualified drivers . we hire the majority of our drivers with at least six to nine months of over-the-road experience and safe driving records . story_separator_special_tag other factors contributing to the decrease in fuel cost per mile , net of fuel surcharge , included increased fuel economy due to newer , more fuel efficient revenue equipment , decreases in fuel surcharge revenues as a percentage of fuel costs due to prices in effect at fuel purchase compared to revenues collected , idle management controls , and a reduction of non-revenue miles as a result of improved network efficiencies . depreciation and amortization increased $ 2.4 million ( 2.2 % ) , to $ 111.0 million during the year ended december 31 , 2015 from $ 108.6 million in the same period of 2014 . the increase is mainly attributable to an increase in the amount of depreciation expense recognized per unit . tractor depreciation increased $ 4.0 million due to a 12.9 % increase in the depreciation recognized per unit during the year ended december 31 , 2015 , compared to the same period of 2014 . as tractors are depreciated using the declining balance method , depreciation expense is highest in the first year of use and declines in subsequent years . compared to 2014 , trailer and other equipment depreciation decreased $ 1.6 million due mainly to a 14.4 % decrease in the number of trailer units depreciated during the year ended december 31 , 2015 , partially offset by 8.8 % higher depreciation expense per unit . operating and maintenance expense decreased $ 5.1 million ( 12.9 % ) , to $ 34.0 million during the year ended december 31 , 2015 , from $ 39.1 million in the same period of 2014 . operating and maintenance costs decreased mainly due to a decrease in the number of revenue equipment units in the fleet and a decrease in miles driven . operating taxes and licenses expense decreased $ 2.3 million ( 11.2 % ) , to $ 18.1 million during the year ended december 31 , 2015 from $ 20.4 million in 2014 , due to a decrease in the number of revenue equipment units ( tractors and trailers ) being licensed and reduced fuel taxes due to less miles driven . insurance and claims expense increased $ 3.7 million ( 20.5 % ) , to $ 21.6 million during the year ended december 31 , 2015 from $ 17.9 million in 2014 , due to increased severity and frequency of claims in 2015 . other operating expenses decreased $ 2.7 million ( 8.6 % ) , to $ 28.6 million , during the year ended december 31 , 2015 from $ 31.3 million in 2014 , due to a decrease in miles driven . gains on the disposal of property and equipment increased $ 1.5 million ( 4.5 % ) , to $ 35.0 million during the year ended december 31 , 2015 , from $ 33.5 million in the same period of 2014 . the increase was mainly the combined effect of an increase of $ 12.2 million in gains on trailer equipment sales , $ 0.8 million increase in gains on sale of real estate property , offset by a decrease of $ 11.5 million in gains on sales of tractor equipment . the increase in gains on trailer sales was due to a 34 % increase in the number of units sold and a gain per unit increase of 57 % . the decrease in gains on sales of tractor equipment was due to a 64 % decrease in gains per unit offset partially by an increase in the number of units sold . we currently anticipate tractor and trailer equipment sale activity during 2016 to decrease significantly compared to 2015 levels with total estimated gains of approximately $ 6.0 to $ 7.0 million . interest expense decreased $ 0.4 million during the year ended december 31 , 2015 compared to 2014. we had outstanding borrowings , on our line of credit , throughout 2014. all outstanding borrowings , on our line of credit , were repaid in january , 2015 . 24 our effective tax rate was 37.4 % and 35.5 % for years ended december 31 , 2015 and 2014 , respectively . the increase in the effective tax rate for 2015 is primarily attributable to the absence of a favorable provision to return adjustment which occurred in 2014. as a result of the foregoing , our operating ratio ( operating expenses as a percentage of operating revenue ) was 84.2 % during the year ended december 31 , 2015 , compared to 84.9 % during the year ended december 31 , 2014 . net income decreased $ 11.8 million ( 13.9 % ) , to $ 73.1 million for the year ended december 31 , 2015 , from $ 84.8 million during the 2014 period as a result of the net effects discussed above . year ended december 31 , 2014 compared with the year ended december 31 , 2013 we acquired 100 % of the outstanding stock of gti on november 11 , 2013 and therefore our operating results for year ended december 31 , 2014 include the operating results of gti for the full year , while our operating results for the year ended december 31 , 2013 include the operating results of gti only for the period of november , 11 , 2013 to december 31 , 2013 . gti 's operations in 2014 impacted operating revenues , salaries , wages and benefits , rent and purchased transportation , fuel expense , operating and maintenance expense , and depreciation and amortization compared to 2013 , as further explained below . per authoritative guidance on segment reporting ,

company-owned retail operations , opening three additional retail sales centers during fiscal 2018. management believes retail expansion provides an opportunity to increase the company 's presence in market segments that are not currently served through its independent retail network , while also providing for increased utilization of existing manufacturing operations . these acquisitions and investments are part of a strategy to grow and diversify revenue with a focus on increasing the company 's hud and modular homebuilding presence in the u.s. as well as improving the results of operations . these acquisitions and investments are included in the consolidated results for periods subsequent to their respective acquisition dates . 23 combination with skyline on january 5 , 2018

to fiscal 2019 are comprised solely of the results of the company . industry and company outlook in recent years , manufactured home construction experienced revenue growth due to a number of favorable demographic trends and demand drivers in the united states , including underlying growth trends in key homebuyer groups , such as the population over 65 years of age , the population of first-time home buyers , and the population of households earning less than $ 50,000 per year . more recently , we see a number of market trends pointing to increased sales of adus and urban to rural migration as customers accommodate working-from-home patterns and protocols , as well as people seeking rent-to-own single-family options . we intend to capitalize on these trends and drivers to grow our business over the medium to long-term . we believe that there is an opportunity for continued manufactured and modular construction market with medium term expansion driven by the foregoing trends and demand drivers , as well as construction labor shortages in certain regions ( which tend to adversely and disproportionally impact supply and cost of site-built homes when compared to manufactured housing ) and increased affordability of factory-built homes relative to site-built homes . for fiscal 2020 , approximately 76 % of the company 's u.s. manufacturing sales were generated from the manufacture of homes that comply with the federal hud code construction standard in the u.s. according to data reported by mhi , hud code industry home shipments were 97,553 ; 93,265 and 90,729 units

segments , and intersegment eliminations . selling , general , and administrative expenses for corporate/other decreased by $ 100.8 million , or 67.3 % , during fiscal 2020 as compared to fiscal 2019. the decrease is mainly due to a change in equity-based compensation expense of $ 93.7 million , primarily related to the exchange and secondary offerings that occurred in the prior year , as well as a

after adjusting for the effect of increased depreciation and amortization , transaction , integration and restructuring costs , and non-cash equity-based compensation incurred in connection with the exchange , and the offerings and the integration of skyline . the increase in operating income is primarily due to improvements in sales volumes and gross profit margins as a percent of net sales

based upon their respective customer base . we include corporate related expenses such as legal , accounting , information technology , product management and other administrative costs that are not otherwise included in our reportable operating segments in corporate & other . in february 2016 , we transitioned out nearly the entire management overhead of our macmall business , thinned out its cost structure and brought it under the management and supervision of our commercial segment . all historical segment financial information provided herein has been revised to reflect this revised operating segment . also , in connection with our acquisitions of acrodex and certain assets of systemax 's north american technology group in the fourth quarter of 2015 , which are described more fully below under “ strategic developments – acquisitions , ” and our resulting entrance into selling technology solutions in the canadian market , we formed a new operating segment called canada . this segment includes our operations related to these canadian market activities , beginning as of the respective dates of these acquisitions . during 2014 , we discontinued the operation of all four of our retail stores , located in huntington beach , santa monica and torrance , california and chicago , illinois , and our onsale and ecost businesses . we reflected the results of these operations , which were historically reported as a part of our macmall segment at the time , as discontinued operations for all periods presented herein in our consolidated balance sheets and consolidated statements of operations . we sell primarily to customers in the united states and canada , and maintain offices in the united states and canada , as well as in manila , philippines . in 2016 , we generated approximately 77 % of our revenue in our commercial segment , 16 % of our revenue in our public sector segment and 7 % of our revenue in our canada segment . our commercial segment sells complex technology solutions to commercial businesses in the united states , using multiple sales channels , including a field relationship-based selling model , an outbound phone based sales force , a field services organization and online extranets . our public sector segment consists of sales made primarily to federal , state and local governments , as well as educational institutions . the public sector segment utilizes an outbound phone and field relationship-based selling model , as well as contract and bid business development teams and an online extranet . our canada segment consists of sales made to customers in the canadian market beginning as of the respective dates of our acquisition of acrodex and certain assets of systemax in october and december 2015 , respectively . we experience variability in our net sales and operating results on a quarterly basis as a result of many factors . we experience some seasonal trends in our sales of technology solutions to businesses , government and educational institutions . for example , the timing of capital budget authorizations for our commercial customers can affect when these companies can procure it products and services . the fiscal year-ends of u.s. public sector customers vary for those in the federal government space and those in the state and local government and educational institution ( “ sled ” ) space . we generally see an increase in our second quarter sales related to customers in the u.s. sled sector and in our third quarter sales related to customers in the federal government space as these customers close out their budgets for their fiscal year . further , our canadian business may see seasonal increases in the first quarter due to canadian sled budgets being closed out in the first quarter . we may also experience variability in our gross profit and gross profit margin as a result of changes in the various vendor programs we participate in and its effect on the amount of vendor consideration we receive from a particular vendor , which may be impacted by a number of events outside of our control . as such , the results of interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for any other interim period or for the full year . 32 a substantial portion of our business is dependent on sales of cisco , hp inc. and microsoft products as well as products purchased from other vendors including apple , dell , hewlett packard enterprise , ingram micro , lenovo , and tech data . our top sales of products by manufacturer as a percent of our gross billed sales were as follows for the periods presented : replace_table_token_7_th our planned operating expenditures each quarter are based in large part on sales forecasts for the quarter . if our sales do not meet expectations in any given quarter , our operating results for the quarter may be materially adversely affected . our narrow margins may magnify the impact of these factors on our operating results . story_separator_special_tag the assets were acquired by an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of pcm , which subsidiary now operates under the en pointe brand . under the terms of the agreement , we paid an initial purchase price of $ 15 million in cash and an additional $ 2.3 million for inventory . we agreed to pay certain contingent earn-out consideration , including 22.5 % of the future adjusted gross profit of the business and 10 % of certain service revenues over the three years following the closing of the acquisition . as of december 31 , 2016 , we have estimated that the fair value of contingent consideration to be paid throughout the earn-out period ending march 31 , 2018 to be approximately $ 38.6 million , representing no change from december 31 , 2015. during 2016 and 2015 , we made $ 13.1 million and $ 8.9 million , respectively , of earn-out payments to the sellers of en pointe . the fair value of this contingent consideration is determined and accrued based on a probability weighted average of possible outcomes that would occur should certain financial metrics be reached . because there is no market data available to use in valuing the contingent consideration , we developed our own assumptions related to the future financial performance of the businesses to determine the fair value of this liability . as such , the valuation of the contingent consideration is determined using level 3 inputs . the significant inputs into the calculation of the contingent consideration include projected gross profit values of the commercial and public sector components of en pointe and the weighted average cost of capital of each component . the accounting for the acquisition of en pointe was finalized as of december 31 , 2015. the purchase price has been allocated to the acquired assets and assumed liabilities , which include , but are not limited to , fixed assets , licenses , intangible assets and professional liabilities , based on estimated fair values as of the date of acquisition . based on various supplier diversity policies and requirements of certain customers whose contracts we acquired rights to in connection with the en pointe transaction , we have been required to transfer these contracts to partners which qualify for certification from third party diversity organizations as minority or women owned businesses . the contracts include contracts which have been transferred to a minority and woman owned and controlled pcm partner in which we hold a 49 % passive equity interest . as a consequence of these transfers , we believe that the revenues associated with some of these customer contracts may not be consolidated with our financial results going forward . we believe the potential impact on 2017 net sales of such transfers may be at least $ 65 million . we expect that the transfer of these customer contracts to non-consolidated partners will have a negative impact on our consolidated net sales in future periods . however , we have not yet completed our consolidation analysis related to our investment in this entity and this conclusion may change . 34 erp upgrades we have been in the process of upgrading our erp systems due to the discontinued third party support of certain of our aged legacy systems , our changing it needs when considering the transitioning state of our business from our origins towards becoming a leading it solution provider and the ongoing desire to integrate multiple systems upon which we currently operate as a result of multiple acquisitions . in this regard , we previously purchased licenses for microsoft dynamics ax and other related modules to provide a complete , robust and integrated erp solution and have expended time , effort and resources to implement this ax solution for our legacy businesses . we believe the implementation and upgrade of our systems should help us to gain further efficiencies across our organizations . our newly acquired en pointe business has operated for a number of years on an implemented and successfully functioning sap system . as a result of the en pointe acquisition , we considered new issues related to the costs , risks and benefits of either continuing the implementation of our ax solution and moving en pointe to such ax solution or moving the legacy businesses to the sap solution . in response , we shifted certain of our it development efforts towards assessing these respective costs , risks and benefits . there are significant risks and uncertainties in adopting and implementing a new erp system and as part of our assessment of these alternatives , we considered the fact that en pointe has been successfully functioning on its sap system for many years while none of our businesses have operated on the ax system . while we believe the ax solution has many valuable features and that it has been essential that we have undertaken our ax development efforts to date , we have weighed these attributes and the transition risk inherent with any such new solution against the fact that en pointe , with similar business characteristics and system needs to our legacy businesses , has been successfully operating on its sap system for a number of years . as a result of the assessments performed , our management concluded that the sap solution is the best , most viable and cost effective option for our consolidated business going forward . to that end , in late october 2015 , our management determined , and our board of directors approved such determination , to adopt the sap platform across all of our business units and approved the non-cash write-off of the remaining $ 22.1 million of work in process software previously capitalized for all major phases of the design , configuration and customization of the ax solution to date . for the year ended december 31 , 2015 , a total of $ 25.4 million of non-cash charge related to the erp and crm write-offs were included in “ selling , general and administrative expenses ” on our consolidated statements of operations .

( “ tortoisecorp ” ) entered into a business combination with each of the shareholders of hyliion inc. ( “ legacy hyliion ” ) , and consummated the merger contemplated by the business combination , with legacy hyliion surviving the merger as a wholly-owned subsidiary of tortoisecorp . as a result of the business combination , we became a nyse listed company . our mission is to be the leading provider of electrified powertrain solutions for the commercial vehicle industry . our goal is to reduce the carbon intensity and the ghg emissions of the transportation sector by providing electrified powertrain solutions for class 8 commercial vehicles at the lowest tco . our solutions utilize our proprietary battery systems , control software and data analytics , combined with fully integrated electric motors and power electronics , to produce electrified powertrain systems that either augment , in the case of our hybrid system , or fully replace , in the case of the hypertruck erx system , traditional diesel or natural gas fueled powertrains and improve their performance . by reducing both ghg emissions and tco , our environmentally conscious solutions support our customers ' pursuit of their sustainability and financial objectives . we are currently developing two electrified powertrain systems for long-haul class 8 commercial vehicles : our hybrid system and our hypertruck erx system . our hybrid system has been installed in low volumes on our initial customers ' commercial vehicles . across the customer installations and over the entire hyliion fleet we have accumulated millions of real world road miles on class 8 commercial vehicles . our hybrid system can either be installed on a new vehicle during assembly and prior to entering fleet service or retrofit to an existing in-service vehicle . our hypertruck erx system is in the development stage with vehicles being built for testing and validation . our hypertruck erx system 's design and technology leverages the experience and operating data from our hybrid system to replace the traditional diesel powertrain installed in new vehicles . our hypertruck erx system will offer commercial vehicle owners and operators a net carbon negative electrified powertrain option for class 8 commercial vehicles , when using certain renewable natural gas ( “ rng ” ) . our initial expected deliveries of our hypertruck erx systems to customers are designed to have their batteries recharged with compressed natural gas ( “ cng ” ) . cng fueled recharging is preferable due to both the current comparable cost of fuels and existing availability of cng refueling infrastructure . class 8 commercial vehicles can currently be refueled with cng through existing , geographically diverse and third-party accessible natural gas refueling stations established across north america . globally , rng , cng and liquefied natural gas ( “ lng ” ) are used widely for land-based transport and trucking and hyliion believes there are established , geographically diverse and third-party accessible refueling stations available in certain areas in which hyliion expects it may sell its electrified powertrain solutions in the future . we believe there is opportunity for adoption of our electrified powertrain solutions across europe . this existing and accessible refueling infrastructure will significantly reduce the buildout time and cost required to utilize our hypertruck erx system as compared to other proposed potential electrified solutions . see “ risk factors — our future growth is dependent upon the commercial trucking industry 's willingness to adopt alternative fuel , hybrid and electric vehicles. ” our hybrid and hypertruck erx systems are designed to be installed on most major class 8 commercial vehicles , which gives our customers the flexibility to continue using their preferred vehicle brands and maintain their existing fleet maintenance and operations strategies . our early hybrid system deployments include leaders in the transportation and logistics sector . we are focusing its initial marketing efforts on large fleet operators as well as companies committed to reducing the overall environmental impact and fuel costs of their owned and operated trucking fleets . 41 recent developments none . story_separator_special_tag key components of statements of operations research and development expense research and development expenses consist primarily of costs incurred for the discovery and development of our electrified powertrain solutions , which include : ● personnel-related expenses including salaries , benefits , travel and share-based compensation , for personnel performing research and development activities ; ● fees paid to third parties such as consultants and contractors for outsourced engineering services ; ● expenses related to materials , supplies and third-party services ; ● depreciation for equipment used in research and development activities ; and ● allocation of general overhead costs . we expect research and development costs to increase for the foreseeable future as we continue to invest in research and development activities to achieve operational and commercial goals . selling , general and administrative expense selling , general and administrative expenses consist of personnel-related expenses for our corporate , executive , finance , sales , marketing and other administrative functions , expenses for outside professional services , including legal , audit and accounting services , as well as expenses for facilities , depreciation , amortization , travel , sales and marketing costs . personnel-related expenses consist of salaries , benefits and share-based compensation . we expect our selling , general and administrative expenses to increase for the foreseeable future as we scale headcount with the growth of its business , and as a result of operating as a public company , including compliance with the rules and regulations of the u.s. securities and exchange commission , legal , audit , additional insurance expenses , investor relations activities and other administrative and professional services . other income ( expense ) , net other income and expenses consist primarily of interest expense incurred on our debt obligations , interest income earned on our investments , remeasurement gain or loss associated with the change in the fair value on our convertible notes payable derivative liabilities and a loss on the extinguishment of our convertible notes payable . 43 story_separator_special_tag funds . on november 30 , 2020 , we issued a notice of redemption to the warrant holders for a redemption of all of the outstanding warrants , on a cash or in the case of the private placement warrants on a cashless basis . as a result , we raised gross proceeds of $ 140.8 million , $ 16.3 million of which was received during the first quarter of 2021. as of the date of this annual report on form 10-k , we have yet to generate revenue from our core business operations . as of december 31 , 2020 , our current assets were $ 608.1 million , consisting primarily of cash and cash equivalents of $ 389.7 million , short-term investments of $ 201.9 million , and prepaid expenses of $ 16.4 million . our current liabilities were $ 4.7 million primarily comprised of accounts payable , accrued expenses , operating lease liabilities , and our payroll protection program ( “ ppp ” ) loan . we believe the credit quality and liquidity of our investment portfolio as of december 31 , 2020 is strong and will provide sufficient liquidity to satisfy operating requirements , working capital purposes and strategic initiatives . the unrealized gains and losses of the portfolio may remain volatile as changes in the general interest environment and supply/demand fluctuations of the securities within our portfolio impact daily market valuations . to mitigate the risk associated with this market volatility , we deploy a relatively conservative investment strategy focused on capital preservation and liquidity whereby no investment security may have a final maturity of more than 36 months from the date of acquisition or a weighted average maturity exceeding 18 months .. eligible investments under the company 's investment policy bearing a minimum credit rating of a1 , a-1 , f1 or higher for short-term investments and a2 , a , or higher for longer-term investments include money market funds , commercial paper , certificates of deposit , and municipal securities . additionally , all of our debt securities are classified as held-to-maturity as we have the intent and ability to hold these investment securities to maturity , which minimizes the realized losses that we would recognize . however , even with this approach we may incur investment losses as a result of unusual or unpredictable market developments , and we may experience reduced investment earnings if the yields on investments deemed to be low risk remain low or decline further due to unpredictable market developments . in addition , these unusual and unpredictable market developments may also create liquidity challenges for certain of the assets in our investment portfolio . based on our past performance , we believe our current assets will be sufficient to continue and execute on our business strategy and meet our capital requirements for the next twelve months . our primary short-term cash needs are paying operating expenses and servicing outstanding indebtedness . we expect to continue to incur net losses in the short term , as we continue to execute on our strategic initiatives by ( i ) completing the development and commercialization of the hybrid and electrified drive systems for long haul “ class 8 ” semi-tractors , ( ii ) scale the company 's operations to meet anticipated demand , and ( iii ) hiring of personnel . however , actual results could vary materially and negatively as a result of a number of factors including , but not limited to , those discussed in the section “ risk factors. ” cash flows the following table summarizes our net cash provided by or used in operating activities , investing activities and financing activities for the

"the warrant to purchase the series b preferred stock expires on october 25 , 2021. on september 30 , 2013 , the company story_separator_special_tag you should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with the section entitled selected financial data and our financial statements and related notes appearing in this 59 annual report on form 10-k. some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k , including information with respect to our plans and strategy for our business and related financing , includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties . as a result of many factors , including those factors set forth in the risk factors section of this annual report on form 10-k , our actual results could differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis . overview we are a clinical stage biotechnology company that discovers and develops novel vaccines to address infectious diseases for which no vaccine or vaccines with limited effectiveness exist today . we use our proprietary discovery platform , atlas , to rapidly design vaccines that act through t cell ( or cellular ) immune responses , in contrast to approved vaccines , which are designed to act primarily through b cell ( or antibody ) immune responses . we believe that by harnessing t cells we can develop first-in-class vaccines to address infectious diseases where t cells are central to the control of the disease . in september 2013 , we announced human proof-of-concept data for gen-003 , a therapeutic vaccine candidate that we are developing to treat herpes simplex virus-2 , or hsv-2 , infections . these data from our ongoing phase 1/2a trial represent the first reported instance of a vaccine significantly reducing viral shedding , an indicator of disease activity in hsv-2 . if gen-003 successfully completes clinical development and is approved , we believe it would represent an important new treatment option for patients with hsv-2 . we are also developing a second t cell vaccine candidate , gen-004 for streptococcus pneumoniae or pneumococcus , a leading cause of infectious disease mortality worldwide . we have initiated a phase 1 trial for gen-004 , which we anticipate completing by mid-2014 . this phase 1 trial is designed to demonstrate the t cell response associated with natural protection against pneumococcus . if this trial is successful , we plan to conduct a phase 2 clinical trial to seek to demonstrate that gen-004 can reduce pneumococcus in humans by mid-2015 . we commenced business operations in august 2006. to date , our operations have been limited to organizing and staffing our company , acquiring and developing our proprietary atlas technology , identifying potential product candidates and undertaking preclinical studies and clinical trials of our product candidates . all of our revenue to date has been grant revenue . we have not generated any product revenue and do not expect to do so for the foreseeable future . we have primarily financed our operations through the issuance of our equity securities , debt financings and amounts received through grants . at december 31 , 2013 , we had received an aggregate of $ 92.0 million in gross proceeds from the issuance of equity securities and gross proceeds from debt facilities and an aggregate of $ 6.7 million from grants . at december 31 , 2013 , our cash and cash equivalents were $ 12.2 million . since inception , we have incurred significant operating losses . our net losses were $ 20.8 million , $ 13.4 million and $ 14.7 million for the years ended december 31 , 2013 , 2012 and 2011 , respectively . at december 31 , 2013 , we had accumulated a deficit of $ 80.1 million . we expect to incur significant expenses and increasing operating losses for the foreseeable future . our net losses may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter and year to year . we will need to generate significant revenue to achieve profitability , and we may never do so . we believe that the net proceeds of our ipo completed in february 2014 , together with our existing cash and cash equivalents at december 31 , 2013 , will enable us to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements through at least the end of 2015 , by which time we expect to have completed our ongoing phase 1/2a clinical trial and the first of our planned phase 2 clinical trials for gen-003 for hsv-2 and our phase 1 clinical trial and our planned phase 2a clinical trial for gen-004 for pneumococcus . however , costs related to clinical trials can be unpredictable and therefore there can be no guarantee that the net proceeds from this offering and from these other sources will be sufficient to fund these studies or our operations through this period . these funds will not be sufficient to enable us to conduct pivotal clinical trials for , seek marketing approval for or commercially launch gen-003 , gen-004 or any other product candidate . accordingly , to obtain marketing approval for and to commercialize these or any other product candidates , we will be required to obtain further funding through public or private equity offerings , debt financings , collaboration and licensing arrangements or other sources . adequate additional financing may not be available to us on acceptable terms , or at all . our failure to raise capital when needed would have a negative effect on our financial condition and our ability to pursue our business strategy . financial overview revenue grant revenue consists of revenue earned to conduct vaccine development research . we have received grants from a private not-for-profit organization and federal agencies . these grants have related to the discovery and development of 60 several of our product candidates , including product candidates for the prevention of pneumococcus , chlamydia , and malaria . story_separator_special_tag accretion of preferred stock reflects the accretion of issuance costs and , for series b preferred stock , cumulative dividends based on their respective redemption values . on february 10 , 2014 , we closed an initial public offering of our common stock and all shares of preferred stock were converted into 11,435,580 shares of our common stock . no accretion of preferred stock will be recorded after this date as no shares of preferred stock will be outstanding . critical accounting policies and significant judgments and estimates our management 's discussion and analysis of our financial position and results of operations is based on our financial statements , which have been prepared in accordance with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles , or gaap . the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes . on an ongoing basis , we evaluate estimates , which include , but are not limited to , estimates related to clinical trial accruals , stock-based compensation expense , warants to purchase redeemable securities , and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported period . we base our estimates on historical experience and other market-specific or other relevant assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances . actual results may differ materially from those estimates or assumptions . while our significant accounting policies are described in more detail in the notes to our financial statements appearing elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k , we believe the following accounting policies to be most critical to the judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements . accrued research and development expenses as part of the process of preparing our financial statements , we are required to estimate our accrued research and development expenses and other current liabilities . this process involves reviewing open contracts and purchase orders , 62 communicating with our personnel to identify services that have been performed for us and estimating the level of service performed and the associated cost incurred for the service when we have not yet been invoiced or otherwise notified of the actual cost . the majority of our service providers invoice us monthly in arrears for services performed or when contractual milestones are met . we make estimates of our accrued research and development expenses and other current liabilities as of each balance sheet date in our financial statements based on facts and circumstances known to us at that time . we periodically confirm the accuracy of our estimates with the service providers and make adjustments , if necessary . examples of estimated accrued research and development expenses and other current liabilities include fees paid to cros in connection with clinical trials , cmos with respect to pre-clinical and clinical materials and intermediaries and vendors in connection with preclinical development activities . we base our expenses related to clinical trials on our estimates of the services performed pursuant to contracts with clinical sites that conduct clinical trials on our behalf . the financial terms of these agreements are subject to negotiation , vary from contract to contract and may result in uneven payment flows . payments under some of these contracts depend on factors such as the successful enrollment of subjects and the completion of required data submission . in accruing service fees , we estimate the time period over which services will be performed , enrollment of subjects , number of sites and services performed in each period . additionally , we accrue 10 % of the earned amounts at each clinical site , which is payable upon completion of the required data submission for the clinical trial . if our estimates of the status and timing of services performed differs from the actual status and timing of services performed we may report amounts that are too high or too low in any particular period . to date , there has been no material differences from our estimates to the amount actually incurred . stock-based compensation since our inception in august 2006 , we have applied the fair value recognition provisions of financial accounting standards board accounting standards codification , or asc , topic 718 , compensation  stock compensation , or asc 718 , to account for stock-based compensation for employees and asc 718 and asc 505 , equity , or asc 505 , for non-employees . we recognize compensation costs related to stock options granted to employees based on the estimated fair value of the awards on the date of grant . stock compensation related to non-employee awards is re-measured at each reporting period until the awards are vested . described below is the methodology we have utilized in measuring stock-based compensation expense . determining the amount of stock-based compensation to be recorded requires us to develop estimates of the fair value of stock-based awards as of their measurement date . we recognize stock-based compensation expense over the requisite service period , which is the vesting period of the award . calculating the fair value of stock-based awards requires that we make highly subjective assumptions . we use the black-scholes option pricing model to value our stock option awards . use of this valuation methodology requires that we make assumptions as to the volatility of our common stock , the fair value of our common stock on the measurement date , the expected term of our stock options , the risk free interest rate for a period that approximates the expected term of our stock options and our expected dividend yield . because we are a privately held company with a limited operating history , we utilize data from a representative group of publicly traded companies to estimate expected stock price volatility . we selected representative companies from the biopharmaceutical industry with characteristics similar to us . we use the simplified method as prescribed by the sec staff accounting bulletin no .

a nine tier risk rating system to grade its loans . the grade of a loan may change during the life of the loan . the risk ratings are described as follows . 1. zero ( 0 ) unclassified . any loan which has not been assigned a classification . 2. one ( 1 ) excellent . credit to premier customers having the highest credit rating based on an extremely strong financial condition , story_separator_special_tag critical accounting policies and estimates the company 's consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america , and the company follows general practices within the financial services industry in which it operates . at times the application of these principles requires management to make assumptions , estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes . these assumptions , estimates and judgments are based on information available as of the date of the financial statements . as this information changes , the financial statements could reflect different assumptions , estimates and judgments . certain policies inherently have a greater reliance on assumptions , estimates and judgments and as such have a greater 20 possibility of producing results that could be materially different than originally reported . examples of critical assumptions , estimates and judgments are when assets and liabilities are required to be recorded at fair value , when a decline in the value of an asset not required to be recorded at fair value warrants an impairment write-down or valuation reserve to be established , or when an asset or liability must be recorded contingent upon a future event . all significant accounting policies followed by the company are presented in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements . these policies , along with the disclosures presented in the notes to the consolidated financial statements and in the management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations , provide information on how significant assets and liabilities are valued and how those values are determined for the financial statements . based on the valuation techniques used and the sensitivity of financial statement amounts to assumptions , estimates and judgments underlying those amounts , management has identified the determination of the allowance for loan and lease losses ( alll ) and the valuation of its mortgage servicing rights ( msr ) and other real estate owned ( oreo ) as the accounting areas that requires the most subjective or complex judgments , and as such could be the most subject to revision as new information becomes available . assets acquired through , or in lieu of , loan foreclosure are held for sale and are initially recorded at fair value at the date of foreclosure . subsequent to foreclosure , valuations are periodically performed by management and the assets are carried at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell . the alll represents management 's estimate of credit losses inherent in the bank 's loan portfolio at the report date . the estimate is a composite of a variety of factors including experience , collateral value , and the general economy . alll includes a specific portion , a formula driven portion , and a general nonspecific portion . the collection and ultimate recovery of the book value of the collateral , in most cases , is beyond our control . the company is also required to estimate the value of its msr . the company recognizes as separate assets rights to service fixed rate single-family mortgage loans that it has sold without recourse but services for others for a fee . mortgage servicing assets are initially recorded at cost , based upon pricing multiples as determined by the purchaser , when the loans are sold . mortgage servicing assets are carried at the lower of the initial carrying value , adjusted for amortization , or estimated fair value . amortization is determined in proportion to and over the period of estimated net servicing income using the level yield method . for purposes of determining impairment , the mortgage servicing assets are stratified into like groups based on loan type , term , new versus seasoned and interest rate . the valuation is completed by an independent third party . the expected and actual rates of mortgage loan prepayments are the most significant factors driving the potential for the impairment of the value of mortgage servicing assets . increases in mortgage loan prepayments reduce estimated future net servicing cash flows because the life of the underlying loan is reduced . the company 's mortgage servicing rights relating to loans serviced for others represent an asset of the company . this asset is initially capitalized and included in other assets on the company 's consolidated balance sheet . the mortgage servicing rights are then amortized against noninterest income in proportion to , and over the period of , the estimated future net servicing income of the underlying mortgage servicing rights . story_separator_special_tag the strategy will expand to our business depositors in 2017 as those product and services will be revamped . the success of this consumer strategy is evidenced by the growth in core deposits along with increased debit card activity , on-line statement usage and lower cost of funds . short-term rates increased slightly in december of 2015. the slope of the yield curve for most of 2015 and 2016 , enabled the company to continue to sell investment securities with shorter term maturities and recognize a gain without compromising the yield . the proceeds were mainly used to fund loan growth . for 2016 , the recognized gain on the sale of securities was $ 588 thousand , higher than 2015 's recognized gain of $ 451 thousand and 2014 's $ 494 thousand . the bank was able to continue to capitalize on the steepness of the yield curve . the market value of the security portfolio has decreased as evidenced by the decrease in comprehensive income reported on the income statement . the company will continue to look for opportunities to utilize the sale of securities from the investment portfolio to fund loan growth . to facilitate the availability of the investment portfolio to be used for loan growth , the bank has begun to offer the insured cash sweep , ( ics ) , which is a sister product of promontory 's certificate of deposit account registry , ( cdars ) . ics provides fdic insurance coverage through the use of a bank network thereby replacing the use of 22 pledged securities to ohio public depositors and for daily repurchase agreements to the bank 's other sweep customers . the process of accepting the new product began in earnest during the fourth quarter of 2016 and plans to be completed in early 2017. this action does not assure the continued use of the investment portfolio to fund loan growth nor does it assure an ongoing source of income , however , it does assure the availability of the opportunity to do so . throughout 2014 , 2015 and 2016 , the company has done an exceptional job of recognizing opportunities to provide services and products that the low rate environment made possible . a commitment to improve asset quality over the years has also benefited the company . these opportunities are further discussed in the material changes in results of operations . the company remains strong , stable and well capitalized and has the capacity to continue to cover the increased costs of doing business in a tough economy while seeking good loans to improve profitability . the company continues to look for new opportunities to generate and protect revenue while providing additional channels through which to serve our customers and maintain our high level of customer satisfaction . the company plans to continue on its strategy of expansion into new markets , whether by acquisition or the establishment of new branch office locations . story_separator_special_tag rate on the variable loans because of the floors in place and the spread of rate to prime . the floors provided yield protection in the previous lower rate environment and the rising rates wo n't benefit the asset yield until the spread plus prime is higher than the floor . the challenge is to increase the spread during renewals and on new loans . in terms of interest expense , 2016 's increase was due to both an increase in average balances and an increase in rates as compared to 2015 . 24 a decrease in the cost is apparent for 2015 as compared to 2014. unfortunately , in 2015 , as compared to 2014 , the asset yield decreased more than funding costs . as a result , both the net interest margin and spread decreased for the periods of 2015. the impact of the change in the portfolio mix was a factor in the liabilities as it was in the assets . time deposits and other borrowed money term liabilities decreased in interest expense in comparing 2015 to 2014 and increased when comparing 2016 to 2015. saving deposits increased in cost for 2016 and 2015 as compared to the preceding years . fed funds purchased and securities sold under agreement to repurchase increased for both 2016 and 2015 also . while 2016 was due to increased balance and rate , 2015 was due only to higher rates . time deposits and other borrowed money both decreased in cost and balances during 2015. this reversed in 2016 , as both those portfolios increased in average balances and had higher costs associated with them . the bank paid off $ 4.5 million of fhlb borrowings during 2014. the bank again borrowed $ 10 million in december 2015 to fund loan growth . the average balance of other borrowed money was lower by $ 50 thousand for 2015 which calculated to $ 108 thousand as compared to 2014 and the borrowings remained throughout 2016. the following tables present net interest income , interest spread and net interest margin for the three years 2014 through 2016 , comparing average outstanding balances of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities with the associated interest income and expense . the tables show the corresponding average rates of interest earned and paid . the tax-exempt asset yields have been tax adjusted to reflect a marginal corporate tax rate of 34 % . average outstanding loan balances include non-performing loans and mortgage loans held for sale . average outstanding security balances are computed based on carrying values including unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale securities . the percentage of interest earning assets to total assets increased to 93.9 % in 2016 from 92.8 % in 2015 and 89.1 % in 2014. noninterest earning assets increased during 2014 by $ 46.1 million as the earning credit rates paid by our correspondent banks were higher than the interest rates . the bank switched those accounts to noninterest bearing to save costs which resulted in a lower percentage of interest earning assets .
","material changes in results of operations net interest income the discussion now centers on the individual line items of the consolidated statement of income and their effect on net income . this section will focus on the most traditional source of revenue contributing to the profitability of the company , net interest income . net interest income is the difference between interest income earned on interest earning assets , such as loans and securities , and interest expense paid on interest bearing liabilities used to fund those assets , such as interest bearing deposits and other borrowings . net interest income is affected by changes in both interest rates and the amount and composition of earning assets and liabilities . the change in net interest income is most often measured as a result of two statistics  interest spread and net interest margin . the difference between the yields earned on earning assets and the rates paid for interest bearing liabilities represents the interest spread . the net interest margin is the difference of funds ( interest expense ) between the yield on earning assets and the cost as a percentage of earning assets . because noninterest bearing sources of funds such as demand deposits and stockholders ' equity also support earning assets , the net interest margin exceeds the interest spread . as mention previously , the largest factor of the record earnings for 2016 was the $ 3.4 million improvement in net interest income as compared to 2015. in 2015 , net interest income increased $ 326 thousand as compared to 2014. interest and fee income from loans were responsible for the improvement . given that securities were sold to fund the loan growth , interest income from that balance sheet component has declined each of the last two years .

utilized for temporary worksite access , along with related site construction and services to customers in various markets including electrical transmission & distribution , e & p , pipeline , renewable energy , petrochemical , construction and other industries , primarily in the united states and europe . we also sell our manufactured composite mats to customers around the world . our industrial blending operations began in 2020 , leveraging our chemical blending capacity and technical expertise to enter targeted industrial end-markets . our long-term strategy , as approved by our board of directors , includes key foundational elements that are intended to enhance long-term shareholder value creation : end-market diversification – to help reduce our dependency on customers in the volatile e & p industry , improve the stability in cash flow generation and returns on invested capital , and provide growth opportunities into new markets , we have focused our efforts over the past several years on diversifying our presence outside of our historical e & p customer base . these efforts have been primarily focused within our site and access solutions business , where we have prioritized growth in electrical transmission and distribution , pipeline , renewable energy , and construction markets . in 2020 , our industrial solutions segment generated $ 138 million of revenues , including approximately $ 100 million from electrical transmission and distribution and other non-e & p markets . the continued diversification of our revenues , including end-markets that are likely to benefit from ongoing energy transition efforts around the world , such as electrical transmission and distribution , renewable energy , and geothermal , remains a strategic priority going forward , and we anticipate that our capital investments will primarily focus on industrial end-market expansion . provide products that enhance environmental sustainability – our company has a long history of providing environmentally-friendly technologies to our customers . in the industrial solutions segment , we believe the lightweight design of our fully recyclable dura-base ® matting system provides a distinct environmental advantage for our customers as compared to alternative wood mat products in the market , by eliminating deforestation required to produce wood mat products while also reducing co 2 emissions associated with product transportation . in our fluids systems segment , our family of high-performance water-based fluids systems , which we market as evolution ® and deepdrill ® systems , are designed to enhance drilling performance while also providing a variety of environmental benefits relative to traditional oil-based fluids . the continued advancement of technology that provides our customers with economic benefits , while also enhancing their environmental and safety programs , remains a priority for our research and development efforts . our fluids systems operating results remain dependent on oil and natural gas drilling activity levels in the markets we serve and the nature of the drilling operations ( including the depth and whether the wells are drilled vertically or horizontally ) , which governs the revenue potential of each well . drilling activity levels , in turn , depend on a variety of factors , including oil and natural gas commodity pricing , inventory levels , product demand , and regulatory restrictions . oil and natural gas prices and activity are cyclical and volatile , and this market volatility has a significant impact on our operating results . 22 while our fluids systems revenue potential is driven by a number of factors including those described above , rig count data remains the most widely accepted indicator of drilling activity . average north american rig count data for the last three years is as follows : replace_table_token_3_th _ source : baker hughes company during 2019 , u.s. rig count steadily declined , exiting the year at 805 active rigs , a 26 % decline from the end of 2018. during march 2020 , oil prices collapsed due to geopolitical events along with the worldwide effects of the covid-19 pandemic . as a result , average u.s. rig count declined 52 % in 2020 from 2019. after reaching a low of 244 in mid-august , the u.s. rig count has since increased to 397 as of february 19 , 2021. the canada rig count reflects normal seasonality for this market , with the highest rig count levels generally observed in the first quarter of each year , prior to spring break-up . we anticipate that market activity will continue to improve from current levels , although the ongoing impacts of the covid-19 pandemic and an uncertain economic environment make the timing and pace of recovery difficult to predict . outside of north america land markets , drilling activity is generally more stable as this drilling activity is based on longer-term economic projections and multi-year drilling programs , which typically reduces the impact of short-term changes in commodity prices on overall drilling activity . however , operations in several countries in the emea region experienced activity disruptions and project delays beginning in march 2020 and continuing into 2021 , driven by government-imposed restrictions on movements of personnel , quarantines of staffing , and logistical limitations as a result of the covid-19 pandemic . we expect these disruptions and project delays will continue to impact international activity levels in the near-term , and while we anticipate a general improvement in customer activity during 2021 , the impact from the duration and magnitude of the ongoing health pandemic and related government responses are very difficult to predict . story_separator_special_tag while we expect customer activity across all end-markets to generally improve in 2021 , we currently expect that demand for both rental projects and product sales remains highly dependent on our customers gaining confidence in the broader economic recovery . 24 year ended december 31 , 2020 compared to year ended december 31 , 2019 consolidated results of operations summarized results of operations for 2020 compared to 2019 are as follows : replace_table_token_4_th revenues revenues decreased 40 % to $ 492.6 million for 2020 , compared to $ 820.1

$ 63.4 million decrease in the industrial solutions segment . revenues from our north america operations decreased primarily due to the 52 % reduction in north american rig count . revenues from our international operations decreased by $ 63.7 million ( 31 % ) , primarily driven by activity disruptions and project delays resulting from the covid-19 pandemic as well as lower oil prices . additional information regarding the change in revenues is provided within the operating segment results below . cost of revenues cost of revenues decreased 31 % to $ 473.3 million for 2020 , compared to $ 684.7 million for 2019. this $ 211.5 million decrease was primarily driven by the 40 % decrease in revenues described above . fluids systems segment cost of revenues for 2020 and 2019 includes $

recognition of cumulative foreign currency translation losses related to the substantial liquidation of our subsidiary in brazil , as well as $ 3.0 25 million attributable to the abandonment of certain property , plant and equipment . fluids systems segment for 2019 includes an $ 11.4 million non-cash impairment charge to write-off the goodwill related to this business . foreign currency exchange foreign currency exchange was a $ 3.4 million loss for 2020 compared to a $ 0.8 million gain for 2019 , and reflects the impact of currency translation on assets and liabilities ( including intercompany balances ) that are denominated in currencies other than functional currencies . interest expense , net interest expense was $ 11.0 million for 2020 compared to $ 14.4 million for 2019. interest expense for 2020 and 2019 includes $ 5.2 million and $ 6.2 million , respectively , in noncash amortization of original issue discount and debt issuance costs . the decrease in interest expense is primarily due to lower debt balances as well as a decrease in interest rates on the abl facility . gain on extinguishment of debt the $ 0.4 million gain for 2020 reflects the difference in the amount paid and the net carrying value of the extinguished debt , including original issue discount and debt issuance costs , related to the repurchase of $ 33.1 million of our convertible notes in the open market for $ 29.1 million . provision ( benefit ) for income taxes the benefit for income taxes was $ 11.9 million for 2020 , reflecting an effective tax benefit rate of 13 % . this result primarily reflects the impact of the $ 11.7 million non-cash recognition of cumulative foreign currency translation losses related to the substantial liquidation of our subsidiary in brazil and other nondeductible expenses , as well as the impact of the geographic composition of our pretax loss , where the tax benefit from losses in the u.s was partially offset by the tax expense related to earnings from our international operations . for 2019 , the provision for income taxes was $ 9.8 million despite reporting a small pretax loss for the year . this result reflects the impact of the $ 11.4 million non-deductible goodwill impairment and other nondeductible expenses , as well as the impact of the geographic composition of our pretax loss , where tax expense related to earnings from our international operations is only partially offset by the tax benefit from losses in the u.s. 26 operating segment results summarized financial information for our reportable segments is shown in

the primary measure used by our chief operating decision maker to evaluate segment operating performance . adjusted oibda is also a key factor that is used by our internal decision makers to ( i ) determine how to allocate resources to segments and ( ii ) evaluate the effectiveness of our management for purposes of incentive compensation plans . as we use the term , adjusted oibda is defined as operating income or loss before share-based compensation , depreciation and amortization , provisions and provision releases related to significant litigation and impairment , restructuring and other operating items . other operating items include ( i ) gains and losses on the disposition of long-lived assets , ( ii ) third-party costs directly associated with successful and unsuccessful acquisitions and dispositions , including legal , advisory and due diligence fees , as applicable , and ( iii ) other acquisition-related items , such as gains and losses on the settlement of contingent consideration . our internal decision makers believe adjusted oibda is a meaningful measure because it represents a transparent view of our recurring operating performance that is unaffected by our capital structure and allows management to ( i ) readily view operating trends , ( ii ) perform analytical comparisons and benchmarking between segments and ( iii ) identify strategies to improve operating performance in the different countries in which we operate . we believe our adjusted oibda measure is useful to investors because it is one of the bases for comparing our performance with the performance of other companies in the same or similar industries , although our measures may not be directly comparable to similar measures used by other public companies . adjusted oibda should be viewed as a measure of operating performance that is a supplement to , and not a substitute for , operating income or loss , net earnings or loss and other u.s. gaap measures of income ( loss ) . a reconciliation of total operating income ( loss ) , the nearest u.s. gaap measure , to adjusted oibda on a consolidated basis , is presented below . replace_table_token_10_th

"overview we are an advanced electronic materials provider that develops , manufactures and sells monocrystalline sapphire and other innovative crystalline products for light-emitting diodes ( leds ) , radio frequency integrated circuits ( rfics ) , blue laser diodes , optoelectronics and other optical applications . the emergence of sapphire in commercial volumes at competitive prices has enabled the development of new technologies such as high-brightness ( hb ) white , blue and green leds and highly-integrated rfics . we apply our proprietary crystal growth technology to produce high-quality sapphire products efficiently to supply our end markets , and we work closely with our customers to meet their quality and delivery needs . we are a vertically integrated manufacturer of high-quality sapphire substrates and optical windows that are used in a variety of high-growth , high-volume end-market applications . during 2012 and 2011 , our largest product sales were six-inch polished sapphire wafers ( substrates ) for use in led applications and in silicon-on-sapphire ( sos ) rfics . two through four-inch diameter sapphire cores were our second largest product sales category during 2012 and 2011 , and comprised the majority of our sales prior to 2011. cores are sold to sapphire polishers who make wafers for use in leds and blue laser diodes . we also sell sapphire products used for windows and lenses in military , aerospace , sensor and other applications . we have extended our technology , giving us the ability to produce cores and wafers of up to twelve inches in diameter to support next generation led and rfic production . in addition , we have developed the ability to produce large diameter circular and rectangular sapphire windows for use in various optical window applications . our revenue consists of sales of sapphire materials sold in core , as-cut , as-ground and polished wafer forms in two , three , four , six and eight inch diameters as well as optical materials sold as blanks or polished windows . products are made to varying specifications , such as crystal planar orientations and thicknesses . we recognize research and development revenue in the period during which the related costs and fees are incurred . we sell our products on a global basis . the asian , north american and european markets accounted for 48 % , 17 % and 35 % , respectively , of our revenue for the year ended december 31 , 2012 , 87 % , 9 % and 4 % , respectively , of our revenue for the year ended december 31 , 2011 , and 90 % , 8 % and 2 % , respectively , of our revenue for the year ended december 31 , 2010. demand from the led market was very strong starting in 2010 continuing through mid-year 2011 , particularly in asia where there is a high concentration of customers that participate in the led market . demand for our products from the led market slowed in the second half of 2011 due to a slowdown in led chip sales which resulted in a build-up of inventory in the led supply chain . the decrease in demand from the led market was partially offset by the increased strength of the sos market . the demand for sapphire substrates from the led market is improving but excess sapphire capacity added in the marketplace has kept pricing low throughout 2012 and going into 2013. while we expect demand for led chips to continue to strengthen throughout 2013 with increased adoption of led lighting , it is difficult to predict how quickly the excess capacity will be absorbed and when the pricing environment will improve . demand for our products from the sos market increased considerably in 2012. however , there is some seasonality in that market which is centered around the introduction of new smartphone models so we expect orders to slow in the first half of 2013 with growth resuming in the second half of 2013. we currently depend on a small number of suppliers for certain raw materials , components , services and equipment , including key materials such as aluminum oxide and certain furnace components . if the supply of 27 these components were to be disrupted or terminated , or if these suppliers were unable to supply the quantities of raw materials required , we may have difficulty in finding , or may be unable to find , alternative sources for these items . as a result , we may be unable to meet the demand for our products , which could have a material adverse impact on our business . we manage direct sales primarily from our bensenville , illinois offices . substantially all of our revenue is generated by our direct sales force and we expect this to continue in the future . we manufacture and ship our products from our facilities in the chicago metropolitan area and from our facility in penang , malaysia . we have approximately 237,000 square feet of manufacturing and office space in batavia , franklin park and bensenville , illinois and a 65,000 square foot facility in penang , malaysia , which processes sapphire grown by us in our illinois facilities into finished cores and wafers . our malaysia facility currently finishes the majority of our core production and can produce production volumes of polished wafers . in march 2012 , we acquired additional land in batavia , illinois to expand our crystal growth capacity . we have not yet determined when we will begin construction on this facility . financial operations revenue . our revenue consists of sales of sapphire materials sold in core , as-cut , as-ground and polished forms in two , three , four , six and eight-inch diameters as well as optical materials sold as blanks or polished windows . products are made to varying specifications , such as crystal planar orientations and thicknesses . we recognize research and development revenue in the period during which the related costs are incurred . story_separator_special_tag our updated analysis of ownership changes that limit the utilization of the nols shows no ownership change . our previous analysis of ownership changes that limit the utilization of the nols shows an ownership change but we believe that we are not restricted in our ability to use the full amount of the nols . a full valuation allowance was provided and no tax benefit was recorded until we could conclude that it is more likely than not that our deferred tax assets will be realized . during the twelve months ended december 31 , 2011 , we concluded that based on the current level of sustainable profitability that generates taxable income , it is more likely than not that our deferred tax assets will be realizable . we recognized a tax benefit of $ 3.3 million to record current and long-term deferred tax assets during the twelve months ended december 31 , 2011. with the release of the valuation allowance , we began recording federal and certain state and non-u.s. income taxes attributable to the fiscal year 's pre-tax income . the reversal of the valuation allowance favorably impacts our effective tax rate in 2011. the illinois state legislature has suspended the use of nols for taxable years ending after december 31 , 2010 and before december 31 , 2011 , and has limited the net operation loss deduction to $ 100,000 for the years ending december 31 , 2012 through december 31 , 2014. in addition , illinois has increased the corporate income tax rate which unfavorably impacts our effective tax rate . our effective tax rate could fluctuate significantly on a quarterly basis and could be adversely affected to the 29 extent earnings are lower than anticipated . our effective tax rate could also fluctuate due to changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets or liabilities , or by changes in tax laws , regulations or accounting principles , as well as certain discrete items . stock-based compensation . the majority of our stock-based compensation relates primarily to administrative personnel and is accounted for as a g & a expense . for the years ended december 31 , 2012 , 2011 and 2010 , our stock-based compensation expense was $ 2.0 million , $ 2.5 million and $ 2.3 million , respectively . story_separator_special_tag million due to lower volume . we also had higher revenue of $ 3.1 million from optical products due to increased sales of sapphire for sensor and instrumentation applications . during the second half of 2011 , demand from the led market weakened due to excess inventory in the supply chain . as a result , prices for our products declined . while demand for large diameter polished wafers was strong throughout 2011 , the prolonged weakness in the led market impacted pricing for this product in the fourth quarter as customers for this product accumulated excess inventory as well . gross profit . gross profit was $ 69.6 million for the year ended december 31 , 2011 and $ 41.2 million for the year ended december 31 , 2010 , an increase of $ 28.4 million . the increase in gross profit is primarily attributable to higher revenue due to increased core pricing in the first half of 2011 and higher volume sales of polished wafers . general and administrative expenses . g & a expenses were $ 11.3 million for the year ended december 31 , 2011 and $ 9.9 million for the year ended december 31 , 2010 , an increase of $ 1.4 million . our bad debt expense increased by $ 1.7 million as we made accommodations to certain key customers of our small diameter cores by agreeing to write off a portion of their accounts receivable balances . also , investor relations expense increased $ 728,000 , primarily due to increased outside support services and investor relations consulting , audit fees increased $ 84,000 , tax consulting expense increased $ 102,000 and executive travel expenses increased $ 111,000 , primarily due to increased frequency in travel outside the u.s. g & a expenses for the malaysia facility were also $ 202,000 higher as the facility began to incur g & a expenses starting in the third quarter of 2010. the g & a increases noted above were partially offset by a decrease of employee compensation costs of $ 1.8 million , resulting from a lower performance based bonus of $ 2.1 million , offset by an increase of $ 143,000 from annual salary increases and expenses associated with issuance and exercise of employee stock options and $ 158,000 of recruiting expenses . sales and marketing expenses . sales and marketing expenses were $ 1.7 million for the year ended december 31 , 2011 and $ 1.3 million for the year ended december 31 , 2010 , an increase of $ 391,000. the 32 increase in sales and marketing expenses is attributable to additional employee compensation costs primarily due to annual salary increases , employee stock options expense and additional sales hires to support expansion as well as increased travel expense . research and development expenses . r & d expenses were $ 1.8 million for the year ended december 31 , 2011 and $ 1.1 million for the year ended december 31 , 2010 , an increase of $ 727,000. the increase is attributable to higher employee compensation costs of $ 246,000 and an increase in spending on research projects of $ 458,000. other income ( expense ) . other expense was $ 118,000 for the year ended december 31 , 2011 and other income $ 346,000 for the year ended december 31 , 2010 , a decrease in other income of $ 464,000. the decrease was primarily due to a $ 106,000 decrease in interest income on lower investment balances as well as a $ 350,000 realized loss on foreign currency translation . income tax expenses .

and where borrowers file bankruptcy , the charge-off occurs when the loan becomes 60 days delinquent . the amount of the charge-off is determined by comparing the loan balance to the estimated fair value of the underlying collateral , less disposition costs , with the loan balance in excess of the estimated fair value charged-off against the allowance for loan losses . the allowance for loan losses for non-performing loans is determined by applying asc 310. for restructured loans that are less than 90 days delinquent , the allowance for loan losses are segregated into ( a ) individually evaluated allowances for those loans with applicable discounted cash flow calculations or ( b ) collectively evaluated allowances based on the aggregated pooling method . for non-performing loans less than 60 days delinquent where the borrower has filed bankruptcy , the collectively evaluated allowances are assigned based on the aggregated pooling method . for non-performing commercial real estate loans , individually evaluated allowances are calculated based on their fair values and if their fair values are higher than their loan balances , no allowances are required . a troubled debt restructuring ( “ restructured loan ” ) is a loan which the corporation , for reasons related to a borrower 's financial difficulties , grants a concession to the borrower that the corporation would not otherwise consider . the loan terms which have been modified or restructured due to a borrower 's financial difficulty , include but are not limited to : a ) a reduction in the stated interest rate . b ) an extension of the maturity at an interest rate below market . c ) a reduction in the accrued interest . d ) extensions , deferrals , renewals and rewrites . the corporation measures the allowance for loan losses of restructured loans based on the difference between the original loan 's carrying amount and the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the original effective yield of the loan . based on published guidance with respect to restructured loans from certain banking regulators and to conform to general practices within the banking industry , the corporation determined it was appropriate to maintain certain restructured loans on accrual status because there is reasonable assurance of repayment and performance , consistent with the modified terms based upon a current , well-documented credit evaluation . other restructured loans are classified as “ substandard ” and placed on non-performing status . the loans may be upgraded and placed on accrual status once there is a sustained period of payment performance ( usually six months or , for loans that have been restructured more than once , 12 months ) and there is a reasonable assurance that the payments will continue ; and if the borrower has demonstrated satisfactory contractual payments beyond 12 consecutive months , the loan is no longer categorized as a restructured loan for sec reporting purposes . in addition to the payment history described above , multi-family , commercial real estate , construction and commercial business loans must also demonstrate a combination of corroborating characteristics to be upgraded , such as : satisfactory cash flow , satisfactory guarantor support , and additional collateral support , among others . to qualify for restructuring , a borrower must provide evidence of their creditworthiness such as , current financial statements , their most recent income tax returns , current paystubs , current w-2s , and most recent bank statements , among other documents , which are then verified by the corporation . the corporation re-underwrites the loan with the borrower 's updated financial information , new credit report , current loan balance , new interest rate , remaining loan term , updated property value and modified payment schedule , among other considerations , to determine if the borrower qualifies . 59 interest is not accrued on any loan when its contractual payments are more than 90 days delinquent or if the loan is deemed impaired . in addition , interest is not recognized on any loan where management has determined that collection is not reasonably assured . a non-performing loan may be restored to accrual status when delinquent principal and interest payments are brought current and future monthly principal and interest payments are expected to be collected . when a loan is categorized as non-performing , all previously accrued but uncollected interest is reversed in the current operating results . when a full recovery of the outstanding principal loan balance is in doubt , subsequent payments received are first applied as a recovery of principal charge-offs and then to unpaid principal . this is referred to as the cost recovery method . a loan may be returned to accrual status at such time as the loan is brought fully current as to both principal and interest , and , in management 's judgment , such loan is considered to be fully collectible on a timely basis .
","general . the corporation recorded net income of $ 10.8 million , or $ 0.96 per diluted share , for the fiscal year ended june 30 , 2012 , as compared to a net income of $ 13.2 million , or $ 1.16 per diluted share , for the fiscal year ended june 30 , 2011. the $ 2.4 million decline in net income in fiscal 2012 was primarily attributable to a $ 10.0 million increase in non-interest expense and $ 1.0 million decrease in net interest income , partly offset by a $ 6.8 million increase in non-interest income and a $ 2.1 million decrease in the provision for income taxes . the increase in non-interest income and non-interest expense are both attributable to an increase in mortgage banking production . the corporation 's efficiency ratio , defined as non-interest expense divided by the sum of net interest income and non-interest income , increased to 69 % in fiscal 2012 from 61 % in fiscal 2011. return on average assets in fiscal 2012 decreased to 0.84 % from 0.97 % in fiscal 2011 and return on average equity in fiscal 2012 decreased to 7.58 % from 9.80 % in fiscal 2011. net interest income . net interest income decreased $ 1.0 million , or 3 % , to $ 36.7 million in fiscal 2012 from $ 37.7 million in fiscal 2011. this decrease resulted principally from a decrease in average earning assets , partly offset by an increase in the net interest margin . the average balance of earning assets decreased $ 59.1 million , or 5 % , to $ 1.24 billion in fiscal 2012 from $ 1.30 billion in fiscal 2011. the net interest margin increased five basis points to 2.95 % in fiscal 2012 from 2.90 % in fiscal 2011. interest income .

financial information that conforms to u.s. gaap . we also present financial information that does not conform to u.s. gaap , as our management believes it is useful to investors . in addition , non-u.s. gaap measures are used by management to review and analyze our operating performance and , along with other data , as internal measures for setting annual budgets and forecasts , assessing financial performance , providing guidance and comparing our financial performance with our peers . it does not purport to represent any similarly titled u.s. gaap information and is not an indicator of our performance under u.s. gaap . investors are cautioned against placing undue reliance on these non-u.s. gaap measures . further , investors are urged to review and consider carefully the adjustments made by management to the most directly comparable u.s. gaap financial measure to arrive at these non-u.s. gaap financial measures , described below . our management assesses our financial results both on a u.s. gaap basis and on a non-u.s. gaap basis , as management believes it is useful to investors . non-u.s. gaap financial measures also provide management with additional means to understand and evaluate the core operating results and trends in our ongoing business by eliminating certain expenses and or gains ( which may not occur in each period presented ) and other items that management believes might otherwise make comparisons of our ongoing business with prior periods and peers more difficult , obscure trends in ongoing operations or reduce management 's ability to make useful forecasts . our non-u.s. gaap financial measures may also be considered in calculations of our performance measures set by the organization and compensation committee of our board of directors for purposes of determining incentive compensation . the non-u.s. gaap financial metrics exclude items that we consider to be certain specified items ( “ special items ” ) , such as restructuring charges and restructuring associated costs , certain transaction and other charges related to acquisitions and divestitures , gains and losses related to acquisitions and divestitures , special tax items or tax benefits ( collectively , “ tax special items ” ) and certain other items . we evaluate unusual or special items on an individual basis . our evaluation of whether to exclude an unusual or special item for purposes of determining our non-u.s. gaap financial measures considers both the quantitative and qualitative aspects of the item , including among other things ( i ) its nature , ( ii ) whether or not it relates to our ongoing business operations , and ( iii ) whether or not we expect it to occur as part of our normal business on a regular basis . our calculation of these non-u.s. gaap measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies due to potential differences between companies in the method of calculation . as a result , the use of these non-u.s. gaap measures has limitations and should not be considered superior to , in isolation from , or as a substitute for , related u.s. gaap measures . when we present forward-looking guidance , we do not also provide guidance for the most directly comparable u.s. gaap financial measures , as they are not available without unreasonable effort due to the high variability , complexity , and low visibility with respect to certain special items , including gains and losses on the disposition of businesses , the ultimate outcome of certain legal or tax proceedings , foreign currency gains or losses resulting from the volatile currency market in argentina , and other unusual gains and losses . these items are uncertain , depend on various factors , and could be material to our results computed in accordance with u.s. gaap . adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin adjusted ebitda is defined as earnings before interest expense , taxes , depreciation and amortization , adjusted to exclude the impact of special items . management uses adjusted ebitda as one of many measures to assess the performance of the business . additionally , adjusted ebitda is the performance metric used by the company 's chief operating decision maker to evaluate performance of our reportable segments . adjusted ebitda is also a metric used to determine performance in the company 's annual incentive plan . we do not believe there are estimates underlying the calculation of adjusted ebitda , other than those inherent in our u.s. gaap results of operations , which would render the use and presentation of adjusted ebitda misleading . while the nature and amount of individual special items vary from period to period , we believe our calculation of adjusted ebitda is applied consistently to all periods and , in conjunction with other u.s. gaap and non-u.s. gaap measures , provides a useful and consistent comparison of our company 's performance to other periods . in our evaluation of adjusted ebitda , management assumes that gain/losses related to special items may not be reflective of our core operating results . 31 the following table shows a reconciliation of u.s. gaap net earnings from continuing operations to non-u.s. gaap total company adjusted ebitda from continuing operations : replace_table_token_3_th ( 1 ) includes depreciation and amortization adjustments of $ ( 0.8 ) million and $ ( 2.4 ) million for the years ended december 31 , 2019 and 2018 , respectively . story_separator_special_tag as a result , our management believes that these

chain and protect valuable goods shipped around the world . we serve an array of end markets including food and beverage processing , food service , retail , and commercial and consumer applications . in the markets we serve , we leverage our iconic brands , leading market positions , differentiated technologies , global scale/market access , and well-established customer relationships . the

reportable segments under fasb asc topic 280. our reportable segments are aligned with similar groups of products and customers . corporate includes certain costs that are not allocated to or monitored by the reportable segments ' management . see note 6 , “ segments , ” of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further information . executive summary of 2019 sealed air continues to execute on its reinvent see strategy that is transforming how the company innovates , operates and solves our customers ' most critical challenges . through our focus on the 4p 's sm of reinvent see , performance , people , products , process and sustainability , we are leveraging our recognized cyrov ac ® and bubblewrap ® brands to fuel future growth opportunities in core and adjacent markets . we believe our efforts to increase recyclability , reusability and recycled or renewable content creates a competitive advantage . the 4p 's sm of reinvent see are driving structural changes throughout the organization with a focus on productivity improvements . during the year , reinvent see structural changes include $ 168 million in benefits , of which $ 67 million was reflected in restructuring savings to delayer and simplify the organization , $ 64 million benefited operating costs and $ 37 million favorably impacted price/cost spread . operating costs benefits were largely driven by material substitution and alternate raw material qualifications , savings on indirect spend , sg & a efficiencies , logistics process improvements , yield improvements and gauge optimization . additionally , we are seeing benefits from manufacturing network optimization reflected in these operating costs . price/cost spread benefits reflect procurement savings and value capture initiatives on price . for the year ended december 31 , 2019 , we incurred approximately $ 102 million , or $ 76 million net of tax , in restructuring and restructuring associated charges primarily related to our reinvent see initiatives . cash payments , including restructuring payments related to reinvent see and legacy programs , were $ 91 million . given the success to date , and the reinvent see initiatives being implemented , we now anticipate that over the 3-year period of the program ( 2019-2021 ) we will realize approximately $ 330 million in benefits , which is an increase of $ 80 million compared to previous estimates . the full year benefits on adjusted ebitda from reinvent see were partially offset by negative foreign currency and higher expense associated with labor inflation , incentive compensation and investments in the business . see note 12 , “ restructuring 34 activities , ” of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional details regarding each of the company 's restructuring programs . the r & d and capital investments we are making in the business are aligned with our sustainability goals . through our 2025 sustainability pledge , we expect to deliver approximately 50 % of our product offerings containing recyclable or reusable solutions by 2023 and are targeting 100 % by 2025. by applying materials science , we are designing and advancing packaging materials to be recyclable or reusable and contain more recycled or renewable content . we are involved in collaborations with partners worldwide to increase circularity . for example , in food care , the majority of our case ready portfolio already meets recyclability requirements . we continue to innovate our materials to lighten the weight and or increase recyclable or renewable content , while at the same time , maintaining the high-performance standards our cryovac ® brand food packaging represents around the world . in product care , our fully recyclable cushioned mailer portfolio and our paper-based products are gaining traction in emea . in 2019 , we launched new recyclable bubblewrap ® brand cushioning in north america with 90 % recycled content . both our bubblewrap ® brand cushioning and our stealthwrap ® shrink film were certified for store-drop off recycling in 2019. stealthwrap ® automated packaging system replaces larger , heavier , secondary boxes and provides improved efficiency by reducing dimensional weigh during distribution . in 2019 , we completed the acquisition of automated packaging systems ( “ automated ” ) and the integration is underway . known for its autobag ® brand , automated provides unique and innovative solutions , complete with automated equipment , advanced materials , engineering , and field service . automated is complementary to our protective packaging solutions for e-commerce and fulfillment operations and offers us adjacent opportunities in the food packaging sector , including e-foods , produce , snack foods , and portion-controlled meals . since the acquisition was closed on august 1 , 2019 , automated generated $ 117 million in net sales and contributed $ 13 million in adjusted ebitda through december 31 , 2019. we have already identified cross-selling opportunities and have begun to realize operating cost efficiencies .

direct labor , transportation and manufacturing facility costs . in addition , this category includes all direct costs associated with the company 's technology sales , services and licensing including hardware and software that are resold , third-party fees , and fees paid to inventors or others as a result of technology licenses or settlements , if any . costs of revenue increased 8 % in 2018 as compared to 2017 , primarily due to an increase in paperboard costs and outside service costs at our packaging division . sales , general and administrative compensation costs , decreased 4 % in 2018 as compared to 2017 , primarily due to the impact of an increase of approximately $ 289,000 in compensation costs sharing amounts recognized by the company in 2018 as compared to 2017. the cost sharing amounts relate to an intellectual property monetization program management arrangement the company entered into in november of 2016 , for which the company received funds to offset certain of its compensation expenses associated with the monetization program and is recognizing those funds received from a third party over the estimated service period of the monetization program . depreciation and amortization include the depreciation of machinery and equipment used for production , depreciation of office equipment and building and leasehold improvements , amortization of software , and amortization of acquired intangible assets such as customer lists , trademarks , non-competition agreements and patents , and internally developed patent assets . depreciation and amortization expense decreased by 9 % during 2018 , as compared to 2017 , primarily due to the write-off of the semiconductor patents during 2018 , in conjunction with the gain on extinguishment of liabilities described below . professional fees increased 75 % in 2018 as compared to 2017 , primarily due to an increase in legal fees associated with the company 's intellectual property litigation matters , and an increase in consulting costs incurred at the company 's dss international division for its expansion into the asia pacific market . story_separator_special_tag investing cash flow - during 2018 , the company expended approximately $ 1.0 million on equipment for its packaging and plastic card operations for various machinery , equipment , and software including a folder-gluer machine for packaging and laminating plates for plastic card operations . in addition , the company expended approximately $ 100,000 on intangible assets . financing cash flows - during 2018 , the company made aggregate principal payments on long-term debt of approximately $ 1,188,000. in addition , the company also received proceeds of approximately $ 288,000 from the collection of a

continuing operations and going concern – the accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that we will continue as a going concern . this basis of accounting contemplates the recovery of our assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business . these consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments to the specific amounts and classifications of assets and liabilities , which might be necessary should we be unable to continue as a going concern . while the company has approximately $ 2.3 million in cash , and a positive working capital position of approximately $ 1.1 million as of december 31 , 2018 , respectively , due to the fact that the company has incurred negative cash flows from operating and investing activities over the past two years , and has projected that the company will likely incur negative cash flows from operations in 2019 , the company has determined that it will likely need to raise capital in 2019 to continue as a going concern . the expected use of cash for operations in 2019 will be primarily for funding operating losses , working capital , legal expenses associated with its intellectual property related litigation , and the costs associate with the global roll-out of the company 's authentiguard product line . historically , the company has been able to obtain equity and or debt-based financing , including most recently when the company raised gross proceeds of $ 951,000 in 2017 and $ 1,176,000 in 2018 from the sale of its equity . the company 's management intends to take actions necessary to continue as a going concern . management 's plans concerning these matters includes , among other things , continued growth among our operating segments including international expansion of our authentiguard product , evaluating capital raising alternatives that will increase the company 's cash resources by at least $ 2 million by the end of the second quarter of 2019 , and tightly controlling operating costs and reducing spending growth rates wherever possible . based upon our current amount of cash on hand , management 's historical ability to raise capital , and our ability to manage our cost structure and adjust operating plans if and as required , we have concluded that substantial doubt of our ability to continue as a going concern has been alleviated . off-balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have , or are reasonably likely to have , an effect on our financial condition , financial statements , revenues or expenses . inflation although our operations are influenced by general economic conditions , we do not believe that inflation had a material effect on our results of operations during 2018 or 2017 as we are generally able to pass the increase in our material and labor costs to our customers or absorb them as we improve the efficiency of our operations . critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the u.s. ( “ u.s . gaap ” ) requires management to make judgments , assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes . the company 's consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended december 31 , 2018 describe the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements . use of estimates - the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires the company to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported and disclosed in the financial statements and the accompanying notes . actual results could differ materially from these estimates . on an ongoing basis , the company evaluates its estimates , including those related to the accounts receivable , fair values of intangible assets and goodwill , useful lives of intangible assets and property and equipment , fair values of options and warrants to purchase the company 's common stock , deferred revenue and income taxes , among others . the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable , the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities . revenue recognition - the company adopted accounting standards update 2014-09 ( topic 606 ) “ revenue from contracts with customers ” , effective january 1 , 2018. topic 606 did not have a material impact on the company 's consolidated financial statements . the company sells printed products including packaging printing and fabrication , commercial and security printing and plastic cards and badges , including cards and badges integrated with technology such as rfid and smart chips . the company also provides information technology services and digital authentication products and services to its customers . the company recognizes its products and services revenue based on when the title passes to the customer or when the service is completed and accepted by the customer .

sales for the year ended december 31 , 2016 totaled $ 3,161 million , which represents an decrease of $ 84 million compared with the same period of 2015 . electronics sales were consistent with the prior year , while sales for the other operations decreased sales by $ 99 million . for electronics , higher production volumes , product mix , and net new business increased sales by $ 115 million . unfavorable currency decreased electronics sales by $ 27 million , primarily attributable to the chinese renminbi , euro , and indian rupee , partially offset by the japanese yen . other reductions were associated with customer pricing , net of design savings . the decrease in sales for the other operations was primarily related to the sale of the germany interiors facility on december 1 , 2015 which decreased sales for the year ended december 31 , 2016 by $ 86 million and the wind-down of legacy climate facilities in south america . cost of sales cost of sales decreased $ 118 million for the year ended december 31 , 2016 when compared with the same period in 2015 . cost of sales for electronics decreased $ 32 million while cost of sales for the other operations decreased $ 101 million . for electronics , higher volumes , product mix , and net new business increased cost of sales by $ 100 million . foreign currency decreased cost of sales by $ 37 million primarily attributable to the chinese renminbi , mexican peso , euro , brazilian real , and british pound , partially offset by the japanese yen . net efficiencies , including material , design and usage economics and manufacturing efficiencies decreased cost of sales by $ 95 million . the decrease in cost of sales for the other operations was primarily related to the sale of the germany interiors facility which decreased cost of sales by $ 83 million and the wind-down of legacy climate facilities in south america . gross margin the company 's gross margin was $ 464 million or 14.7 % of sales for the year ended december 31 , 2016 compared to $ 430 million or 13.3 % of sales for the same period of 2015 . electronics gross margin increased year-over-year by $ 32 million while other gross 23 margin increased year-over-year by $ 2 million . the increase in the electronics gross margin included $ 15 million from favorable volumes , net new business and product mix and $ 10 million from favorable currency . electronics gross margin also included $ 7 million of favorable net cost performance , driven by material and manufacturing cost efficiencies , which more than offset customer pricing reductions . selling , general and administrative expenses selling , general , and administrative expenses were $ 220 million , or 7.0 % of sales , and $ 245 million , or 7.6 % of sales , during the years ended december 31 , 2016 and 2015 , respectively . the decrease of $ 25 million is primarily related to net efficiencies and lower incentive compensation expense . restructuring expense electronics : during the first quarter of 2016 , the company announced a restructuring program to transform the company 's engineering organization and supporting functional areas to focus on execution and technology . the organization will be comprised of regional engineering , product management and advanced technologies , and global centers of competence . story_separator_special_tag income taxes the company 's provision for income tax was $ 30 million for year ended december 31 , 2016 and reflects income tax expense related to those countries where the company is profitable , accrued withholding taxes , ongoing assessments related to the recognition and measurement of uncertain tax benefits , the inability to record a tax benefit for pretax losses and or recognize tax expense for pretax income in certain jurisdictions ( including the u.s. ) due to valuation allowances , and other non-recurring tax items . 25 the company 's provision for income taxes increased $ 3 million for the year ended december 31 , 2016 compared with 2015 . the increase included an $ 11 million year-over-year increase in unrecognized tax benefits , including interest and penalties , related primarily to the non-recurrence of favorable audit developments and statute expirations during 2015 , and unfavorable adjustments in 2016 , primarily in connection with intercompany transactions between the u.s. and non-u.s. taxing jurisdictions . other increases include the non-recurrence of an $ 18 million income tax benefit on pretax u.s. losses from continuing operations recognized during the 2015. although the company maintains a full valuation allowance against net deferred tax assets in the u.s. , the level of other categories of income generated in the u.s. during 2015 ( primarily related to discontinued operations ) resulted in a charge to discontinued operations income tax expense of $ 18 million with the offsetting benefit recognized in continuing operations , effectively resulting from a reduction in the valuation allowance against deferred tax assets . these increases were partially offset by the non-recurrence of $ 8 million income tax expense related to the withholding tax associated with the sale of its non-consolidated affiliate located in china and favorable developments in connection with certain portuguese income tax incentives formally approved during 2016 resulting in a discrete income tax benefit of $ 3 million , and year-over-year tax benefits of $ 3 million resulting from the partial elimination of valuation allowances in mexico and france . other changes in the company 's deferred tax asset valuation allowances did not materially impact net tax expense during the years ended december 31 , 2016 or 2015. other decreases reflect the year-over-year changes in the mix of earnings and differing tax rates between jurisdictions . additionally , during 2016 , the company recorded an $ 11 million income tax benefit in connection with the recognition of a worthless stock deduction ( “ wsd ” ) for u.s. income tax purposes related to visteon sa ( the company 's wholly owned subsidiary associated with the company 's climate facility in argentina where manufacturing operations have ceased ) , which resulted in an estimated current year u.s. net operating loss ( nol ) allowing the company to carryback such nol against its 2015 u.s. taxable income . consequently , the company recorded a $ 3 million income tax receivable which represents the remaining income tax paid in 2015 relating to the climate sale ( which should be refunded after carrying back the current year nol to 2015 and filing a refund claim ) , and an $ 8 million reduction in unrecognized tax benefits that impact the effective rate . discontinued operations the operations subject to the interiors divestiture and climate transaction met conditions required to qualify for discontinued operations reporting . accordingly , the results of operations for the interiors and climate businesses have been reclassified to net income ( loss ) from discontinued operations , net of tax in the consolidated statements of operations for the years ended december 31 , 2016 and 2015 . see note 5 `` discontinued operations '' for additional disclosures . net income net income attributable to visteon was $ 75 million for the year ended december 31 , 2016 , which included a net loss from discontinued operations of $ 40 million , restructuring expense of $ 49 million , higher year over year gross margin of $ 34 million , and lower year over year selling , general and administrative expenses of $ 25 million . net income attributable to visteon was $ 2,284 million for the year ended december 31 , 2015 , which included net income from discontinued operations of $ 2,286 million including the climate transaction gain , a gain on sale of non-consolidated affiliates of $ 62 million , partially offset by a loss on the germany divestiture of $ 105 million , and restructuring expense of $ 36 million . adjusted ebitda adjusted ebitda ( a non-gaap financial measure , as defined below ) was $ 337 million for the year ended december 31 , 2016 , representing an increase of $ 55 million when compared with adjusted ebitda of $ 282 million for the same period of 2015 . adjusted ebitda for the electronics product group in 2016 was $ 346 million , a year-over-year increase of $ 52 million . adjusted ebitda for the other operations in 2016 was a loss of $ 9 million , a year-over-year improvement of $ 3 million , primarily attributable to year over year customer pricing and exchange improvements . the increase in electronics adjusted ebitda included $ 15 million of favorable volume and mix , primarily attributable to increased production volumes and new business in asia pacific . currency movements favorably impacted electronics adjusted ebitda for the year ended december 31 , 2016 by $ 12 million , largely related to the impact of the mexican peso , brazilian real , chinese renminbi , and british pound , partially offset by the japanese yen . electronics adjusted ebitda in 2016 was also impacted by selling , general and administrative cost efficiencies of $ 14 million and gross margin cost efficiencies of $ 11 million . gross margin cost efficiencies included material , manufacturing efficiencies , which more than offset customary customer pricing productivity .

$ 105 million , a majority of which will be production equipment purchases . 2015 capital expenditures are currently anticipated to be financed from current cash and cash equivalents on hand and cash flows from operating activities . the company also estimates that depreciation and amortization expense for calendar year 2015 will be approximately $ 85 - $ 90 million . the company is also estimating that its tax rate will be between 31.5 % and 32.5 % for calendar year 2015. market risk disclosure the company is subject to market risk exposures of varying correlations and volatilities , including foreign exchange rate risk , interest rate risk and equity price risk . volatile equity markets could negatively impact the company 's financial performance due to realized losses on the sale of equity investments and or recognized losses due to other-than- 21 temporary impairment adjustments on available-for-sale securities ( mark-to-market adjustments ) . interest rate fluctuations on the company 's long term debt financing could negatively impact our financial performance due to increased borrowing costs . refer to note 2 of the consolidated financial statements regarding further discussion of the company 's long term debt obligations as well as its interest rate swap transaction entered into on october 1 , 2014. the company has some assets , liabilities and operations outside the united states , including a euro denominated account , which currently are not significant overall to the company as a whole . because the company sells its automotive mirrors throughout the world and automobile manufacturing is highly dependent on general economic conditions , it could be significantly affected by weak economic conditions in foreign markets that could reduce demand for its products . most of the company 's non-u.s. sales are invoiced and paid in u.s. dollars ; during 2014 , approximately 6 % of the company 's net sales were invoiced and paid in foreign currencies ( compared to 7 % for 2013 and 8 % for 2012 ) . the company currently expects that approximately 5 % of the company 's net sales in 2015 will be invoiced and paid in foreign currencies . the company does not currently engage in hedging activities of foreign currencies . most of the company 's equity investments are managed by a number of outside equity fund managers who invest primarily in large capitalization companies traded on the u.s. stock markets : the company does not have any significant off-balance sheet arrangements or commitments that have not been recorded in its consolidated financial statements . see the contractual obligations and other commitments below . contractual obligations and other commitments the company had the following contractual obligations and other commitments ( 000,000 ) as of december 31 , 2014 . replace_table_token_7_th purchase obligations are primarily for raw material inventory and capital equipment . critical accounting policies . the preparation of the company 's consolidated financial statements , which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states , requires management to make estimates , assumptions and apply judgments that affect its financial position and results of operations . on an ongoing basis , management evaluates these estimates and assumptions . management also continually reviews its ' accounting policies and financial information disclosures . the company 's significant accounting policies are described in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements . the policies described below represent those that are broadly applicable to its operations and involve additional management judgment due to the sensitivity of the methods , assumptions and estimates necessary in determining the related amounts . revenue recognition . the company recognizes revenue in accordance with asc 820 , revenue recognition in financial statements . accordingly , revenue is recognized based on the terms of the customer purchase order that indicates title to the product and risk of ownership passes to the customer upon shipment . sales are shown net of returns , which have not historically been significant . the company does not generate sales from sale arrangements with multiple deliverables . in may 2014 the financial accounting standards board ( fasb ) issued the accounting standards update ( asu ) no . 2014-09 , revenue from contracts with customers ( topic 606 ) , that will supersede nearly all existing revenue recognition guidance under us gaap . the core principle of the guidance is that an entity should recognize revenue when it transfers promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the 22 company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services . the standard will be effective for public entities for annual and interim periods beginning after december 15 , 2016. entities can choose to apply the standard using either the full retrospective approach or a modified retrospective approach . entities electing the full retrospective adoption will apply the standard to each period presented in the financial statements .

"we also determined that , pursuant to the accounting guidance governing revenue recognition on multiple element arrangements , the license and undelivered joint steering committee and any additional ttr-specific rnai therapeutic compounds did not have standalone value due to the specialized nature of the services to be provided by us . in addition , while sanofi genzyme had the ability to grant sublicenses , it could not sublicense all or substantially all of its rights under the 2012 sanofi genzyme agreement . the uniqueness of our services and the limited sublicense right were indicators that standalone value was not present in the arrangement . therefore the deliverables were not separable and , accordingly , the story_separator_special_tag financial condition and results of operations overview we are a global biopharmaceutical company developing novel therapeutics based on rnai . rnai is a naturally occurring biological pathway within cells for sequence-specific silencing and regulation of gene expression . we are harnessing the rnai pathway to develop a potential new class of innovative medicines , known as rnai therapeutics . rnai therapeutics are comprised of sirna , and function upstream of today 's medicines by potently silencing mrna that encode for disease-causing proteins , thus preventing them from being made . this is a revolutionary approach with the potential to transform the care of patients with genetic and other diseases . our research and development strategy is to target genetically validated liver-expressed genes that have been implicated in the cause or pathway of human disease . we utilize a lnp or galnac conjugate approach to enable hepatic delivery of sirnas . our focus is on clinical indications where there is a high unmet need , early biomarkers for the assessment of clinical activity in phase 1 clinical studies , and a definable path for drug development , regulatory approval , patient access and commercialization . specifically , our broad pipeline of investigational rnai therapeutics is focused in three stars : genetic medicines ; cardio-metabolic diseases ; and hepatic infectious diseases . we are committed to the advancement of our alnylam 2020 strategy , which is to achieve a company profile with three marketed products and ten rnai therapeutic clinical programs , including four in late stages of development , across our three stars by the end of 2020. in december 2017 , we filed our first nda and maa for patisiran . in january 2018 , we announced that the ema has accepted the maa and initiated its review . patisiran was previously granted an accelerated assessment by the ema . in early february 2018 , we announced that the fda has accepted our nda and granted our request for priority review , with an action date of august 11 , 2018. if approved , we expect to launch patisiran and begin generating product revenues in 2018. in may 2017 , we sold an aggregate of 5,000,000 shares of our common stock through an underwritten public offering at a price to the public of $ 71.87 per share . as a result of the offering , we received aggregate net proceeds of $ 355.2 million , after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and other offering expenses of $ 4.2 million . in november 2017 , we sold an aggregate of 6,440,000 shares of our common stock through an underwritten public offering at a price to the public of $ 125.00 per share . as a result of the offering , which included the full exercise of the underwriters ' option to purchase additional shares , we received aggregate net proceeds of $ 784.5 million , after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and other offering expenses of $ 20.5 million . we have used and intend to continue to use these proceeds for general corporate purposes , focused on achieving our alnylam 2020 strategy . in addition , in april 2016 , our subsidiary , alnylam u.s. , inc. , entered into an aggregate of $ 150.0 million of term loan agreements with bank of america n.a. , or boa , and wells fargo bank , national association , or wells , related to the build out of our new drug substance manufacturing facility . in december 2017 , we repaid in full $ 120.0 million outstanding under the boa term loan agreement . please read note 7 to our consolidated financial statements included in part ii , item 8 , “ financial statements and supplementary data , ” of this annual report on form 10-k for a description of these term loan agreements . we have incurred significant losses since we commenced operations in 2002 and expect such losses to continue for the foreseeable future . at december 31 , 2017 , we had an accumulated deficit of $ 2.15 billion . historically , we have generated losses principally from costs associated with research and development activities , acquiring , filing and expanding intellectual property rights and general administrative costs . as a result of planned expenditures for research and development activities relating to our research platform , our drug development programs , including clinical trial and manufacturing costs , the establishment of late stage clinical and commercial capabilities , including global operations , continued management and growth of our patent portfolio , collaborations and general corporate activities , we expect to incur additional operating losses for the foreseeable future . we also anticipate that our operating results will fluctuate for the foreseeable future . therefore , period-to-period comparisons should not be relied upon as predictive of the results in future periods . we currently have programs focused on a number of therapeutic areas and , in december 2017 , submitted our first nda and maa for marketing approval for patisiran . however , our development efforts may not be successful and we may not be able to commence sales of patisiran or any other product . if we gain approval for and successfully launch patisiran in 2018 , we may begin to generate net revenues from product sales . story_separator_special_tag the fair value of deliverables under the arrangement may be derived using a “ best estimate of selling price ” if vendor specific objective evidence and third-party evidence is not available . deliverables under the arrangement will be separate units of accounting provided that ( i ) a delivered item has value to the customer on a standalone basis and ( ii ) if the arrangement includes a general right of return relative to the delivered item , delivery or performance of the undelivered item is considered probable and substantially in the control of the vendor . we recognize upfront license payments as revenue upon delivery of the license only if the license has standalone value of the undelivered performance obligations , typically including research and or steering committee services , that can be determined . if the fair value of the undelivered performance obligations can be determined , such obligations would then be accounted for separately as performed . if the license is considered to not have standalone value , the arrangement would then be accounted for as a single unit of accounting and the license payments and payments for performance obligations are recognized as revenue over the estimated period of when the performance obligations are performed or deferred until the undelivered performance obligation can be determined . as a biotechnology entity with unique and specialized delivered and undelivered performance obligations , we have been unable to demonstrate standalone value in our multiple element arrangements . whenever we determine that an arrangement should be accounted for as a single unit of accounting , we must determine the period over which the performance obligations will be performed and revenue will be recognized . we recognize revenue using either proportional performance or a straight-line method . we recognize revenue using the proportional performance method when we can reasonably estimate the level of effort required to complete our performance obligations under an arrangement and such performance obligations are provided on a best-efforts basis . direct labor hours or full-time equivalents are typically used as the measure of performance . the amount of revenue recognized under the proportional performance method is determined by multiplying the total payments under the contract , excluding royalties and payments contingent upon achievement of milestones , by the ratio of level of effort incurred to date to estimated total level of effort required to complete our performance obligations under the arrangement . revenue is limited to the lesser of the cumulative amount of payments received or the cumulative amount of revenue earned , as determined using the proportional performance method , as of the period ending date . if we can not reasonably estimate the level of effort required to complete our performance obligations under an arrangement , we recognize revenue under the arrangement on a straight-line basis over the period we expect to complete our performance obligations . revenue is limited to the lesser of the cumulative amount of payments received or the cumulative amount of revenue earned , as determined using the straight-line method , as of the period ending date . significant management judgment is required in determining the level of effort required under an arrangement and the period over which we are expected to complete our performance obligations under an arrangement . steering committee services that are not inconsequential or perfunctory and that are determined to be performance obligations are combined with other research services or performance obligations required under an arrangement , if any , in determining the level of effort required in an arrangement and the period over which we expect to complete our aggregate performance obligations . many of our collaboration agreements entitle us to additional payments upon the achievement of performance-based milestones . these milestones are generally categorized into three types ; development milestones which are generally based on the advancement of our pipeline and initiation of clinical trials , regulatory milestones which are generally based on the submission , filing or approval of regulatory applications such as an nda in the united states , and commercialization milestones which are generally based on meeting specific thresholds of sales in certain geographic areas . if the achievement of a milestone is considered probable at the inception of the collaboration , the related milestone payment is included with other collaboration consideration , such as upfront fees and research funding , in our revenue model . milestones that are tied to regulatory approval are not considered probable of being achieved until such approval is received . milestones tied to counter-party performance are not included in our revenue model until the performance conditions are met . upfront and ongoing development milestones per our collaboration agreements are not subject to refund if the development activities are not successful . we perform an assessment to determine whether a substantive milestone exists at the inception of our collaborative arrangements . in evaluating if a milestone is substantive , we consider whether uncertainty exists as to the achievement of the milestone event at the inception of the arrangement , the achievement of the milestone involves substantive effort and can only be achieved based in whole or part on the performance or the occurrence of a specific outcome resulting from our performance , the amount of the milestone payment appears reasonable either in relation to the effort expected to be expended or to the projected enhancement of the value of the delivered items , there is any future performance required to earn the milestone , and the consideration is reasonable relative to all deliverables and payment terms in the arrangement . when a substantive milestone is achieved , the accounting rules permit us to recognize revenue related to the milestone payment in its entirety . 71 to date , we have not recorded any substantive milestones under our collaborations because we have not identified any milestones that meet the required criteria listed above . we have deferred recognition of payments for achievement of non-substantive milestones and recognized

( `` qurate retail '' ) , entered into an agreement and plan of reorganization ( as amended , the `` reorganization agreement '' and the transactions contemplated thereby , the `` transactions '' ) with gci , llc 's parent company , general communication , inc. ( `` gci '' ) , an alaska corporation , and liberty interactive llc , a delaware limited liability company and a direct wholly owned subsidiary of qurate retail ( `` li llc '' ) . pursuant to the reorganization agreement , gci amended and restated its articles of incorporation ( which resulted in gci being renamed gci liberty , inc. ( `` gci liberty '' ) ) and effected a reclassification and auto conversion of its common stock . following these events , qurate retail acquired gci liberty on march 9 , 2018 through a reorganization in which certain qurate retail interests , assets and liabilities attributed to its ventures group ( following the reattribution by qurate retail of certain assets and liabilities from its ventures group to its qvc group ) were contributed to gci liberty in exchange for a controlling interest in gci liberty ( the `` contribution '' ) . qurate retail and li llc contributed to gci liberty their entire equity interests in liberty broadband corporation ( `` liberty broadband '' ) , charter communications , inc.

"plasma is used for patients with major blood loss and is manufactured into biopharmaceuticals to treat a variety of illnesses , including immune diseases and coagulation disorders . red cells treat trauma patients or patients undergoing surgery with high blood loss , such as open heart surgery or organ transplant . platelets have many uses in patient care , including supporting cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy . blood is essential to a modern healthcare system . recent developments restructuring initiative during fiscal 2017 , we launched a multi-year restructuring initiative designed to reposition our organization and improve our cost structure . this initiative includes a reduction of headcount and operating costs , simplification of certain product lines , and modification of manufacturing operations to align with our strategic direction . the fiscal 2017 phase was expected to incur approximately $ 26 million of restructuring and turnaround charges and was estimated to achieve cost savings of $ 40 million . during fiscal 2017 , we incurred $ 28.7 million of restructuring and turnaround charges under this initiative and exceeded our estimated savings target of $ 40 million . as of april 1 , 2017 , this initial phase was substantially complete . additionally , during fiscal 2017 , we recorded $ 5.6 million of restructuring and turnaround charges under a prior program . we continue to assess non-core and underperforming assets and evaluate opportunities to improve our cost structure as part of our turnaround and expect to incur additional charges and benefits during fiscal 2018 and beyond . pcs ® 300 in april , 2017 , we submitted a new plasmapheresis device , the pcs ® 300 , for 510 ( k ) regulatory clearance with the united states food and drug administration ( `` fda '' ) and continue to work on future enhancements to this important product , some of which may require additional clearances . our planned roll out of this new platform includes the placement of a significant number of new devices . such placements will require meaningful capital expenditures and new customer contracts that reflect pricing and volumes appropriate to these investments . impairments as discussed in note 5 , goodwill and intangible assets , to our consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k , we evaluate goodwill for impairment at least annually , or on an interim basis between annual tests when events or circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value . our reporting units for purposes of assessing goodwill impairment are organized primarily based on operating segments and geography and include : ( a ) north america plasma , ( b ) north america blood center , ( c ) north america hospital , ( d ) emea , ( e ) asia-pacific and ( f ) japan . in the prior period , north america blood center and north america hospital were components of a single reporting unit , americas blood center and hospital . during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 , we completed certain organizational changes which resulted in the disaggregation of americas blood center and hospital into two separate reporting units . as a result of our annual test , we recorded an impairment charge of $ 57.0 million in the north america blood center reporting unit during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 , which represented the entire goodwill balance associated with this reporting unit . during fiscal 2017 , we performed a review of certain non-core and underperforming assets that were at risk of being impaired due to the recent changes in the strategic direction of the company . this review resulted in the decision to discontinue the use of and investment in certain long-lived assets , including property , plant and equipment and intangible assets . accordingly , during fiscal 2017 , we recorded $ 18.1 million of impairment charges , which included the write down of $ 13.3 million of property , plant and equipment and $ 4.8 million of intangible assets . refer to note 5 , goodwill and intangible assets , and note 12 , property , plant and equipment , to our consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k for further information . divestiture on april 27 , 2017 , we sold our sebra sealers product line to machine solutions inc. because it was no longer aligned with our long-term strategic objectives . in connection with this transaction , we received net proceeds of $ 9 million . these proceeds 22 are subject to a post-closing adjustment based on final asset values as determined during the 90 day transition period . the preliminary pre-tax gain expected to be recorded as a result of this transaction is $ 8 million . the sebra portfolio includes a suite of products which primarily include radio frequency sealers that are used to seal tubing as part of the collection of whole blood and blood components , particularly plasma . the sebra product line generated approximately $ 6 million of revenue in our plasma business unit in fiscal 2017. product recall in june 2016 , we issued a voluntary recall of certain whole blood collection kits sold to our blood center customers in the u.s. the recall resulted from some collection sets ' filters failing to adequately remove leukocytes from collected blood . as a result of the recall , our blood center customers may have conducted further tests to confirm the blood was adequately leukoreduced , sold the blood labeled as non-leukoreduced at a lower price or discarded the blood collected using the defective sets . as a result of the recall , we have recorded total charges of $ 7.1 million during fiscal 2017 , which consists of $ 3.7 million of charges associated with customer returns and inventory reserves and $ 3.4 million of charges associated with customer claims , as discussed below . we may record incremental charges in future periods . story_separator_special_tag the use of our teg ® 5000 analyzer continues to expand beyond cardiac surgery into trauma and other clinical uses . teg ® product line sales further strengthened in fiscal 2017 , with strong performance in north america , europe and china . this product 's growth is dependent on hospitals adopting this technology in their blood management programs . the teg ® 6s and teg ® manager are approved for the same set of indications as the teg ® 5000 in europe , australia and japan . in the u.s. , teg ® 6s is approved for limited indications , including cardiovascular surgery and cardiology . the release of teg 6s has significantly contributed to the overall growth in hemostasis management in the u.s. and europe in fiscal 2017. we are pursuing a broader set of indications for the teg ® 6s in the u.s. , including trauma . cell processing market - our cell saver surgical blood salvage system was designed as a solution for procedures that involve mid to high volume blood loss , such as cardiovascular or orthopedic surgeries . in recent years , more efficient blood use and less invasive cardiovascular surgeries have reduced demand for this device and contributed to intense competition in mature markets , while increased access to healthcare in emerging economies has provided new markets and sources of growth . our orthopat technology is used to salvage red cells in orthopedic procedures , including hip and knee replacement surgeries . over the last three years , improved blood management practices , including the use of tranexamic acid to treat and prevent post-operative bleeding , have significantly reduced the use of orthopat . we currently participate in the hospital software market primarily in the u.s and europe . in the u.s. , we have experienced growth in our installed base for our hospital transfusion solution , safetrace tx , due to demand for reliable , proven safety systems within transfusion services . however , growth in the u.s. continues to be constrained due to hospital it organization focus on the electronic medical records mandates . revenues from bloodtrack , a blood inventory and transfusion management system , have increased in the u.s. and europe recently as hospitals seek means to improve efficiencies and meet compliance guidelines for tracking and dispositioning blood components to patients . blood center market in the blood center market , we sell products used in the collection of platelets , red cells and whole blood . whole blood is collected from the donor and then transported to a laboratory where it is separated into its components : red cells , platelets or plasma . while we sell products around the world , a significant portion of our sales are to a limited number of customers due to relatively limited number of blood collectors . 24 platelets are collected globally , although each local market can be quite different . despite modest increases in the demand for platelets in europe and japan , improved collection efficiencies that increase the yield of platelets per collection and more efficient use of collected platelets have resulted in a flat market for automated collections and related disposables in these countries . in particular , the use of `` double dose '' collection methods in europe and japan has increased . double dose collections involve collecting two therapeutic platelet doses from one donor . competition in double dose collection technology is intense and can negatively impact our sales in markets where these collections are prevalent . in addition to changes in the platelet markets , healthcare efficiencies in developed markets have reduced the demand for red cells , which in turn can reduce the demand for our red cell and whole blood collection products . as discussed in recent developments above , while we began to see a moderation in the rate of market decline in u.s. blood center collections during fiscal 2017 , we expect to see continued declines in transfusion rates and the market to remain price-focused and highly competitive for the foreseeable future . in the blood center market for software , we currently participate most actively in the u.s. , where expansion to new or emerging technology platforms such as our el dorado donor has been slow due to industry consolidation and the relatively high cost of migrating to new information technology platforms . this trend has limited revenue growth and will likely continue to minimize potential opportunities in the future . however , in the immediate future high switching costs and recurring maintenance revenue streams from existing customers has provided relative revenue stability in this product group . 25 financial summary replace_table_token_5_th our fiscal year ends on the saturday closest to the last day of march . fiscal 2017 and 2015 include 52 weeks with each quarter

"the origination of subprime and alternative residential mortgage loans has dramatically declined since 2008 and the new qm and atr rule requirements will also put pressure on new originations . additionally , many banks and other mortgage lenders have increased their credit standards and down payment requirements for originating new loans . the combination of these factors has also resulted in a significant number of families that can not qualify to obtain new residential mortgage loans . we believe new u.s. federal regulations addressing “ qualified mortgages ” based , among other factors on employment status , debt-to-income level , impaired credit history or lack of savings , will continue to limit mortgage loan availability from traditional mortgage lenders . in addition , we believe that many homeowners displaced by foreclosure or who either can not afford to own or can not be approved for a mortgage will prefer to live in single-family rental properties with similar characteristics and amenities to owned homes as well as smaller multi-family residential properties . in certain demographic areas , new households are being formed at a rate that exceeds the new homes being added to the market , which we believe favors future demand for non-federally guaranteed mortgage financing for single-family and smaller multi-family rental properties . for all these reasons , we believe that demand for single-family and smaller multi-family rental properties will increase in the near term and remain at heightened levels in the foreseeable future . we expect the availability of pools of re-performing and non-performing loans , properties in foreclosure and reo to increase and remain elevated over the next several years . the single family mortgage delinquency rate at december 31 , 2014 is 6.71 % , according to the federal reserve board . overall housing values have rebounded since 2012 ; however , corelogic ® , a leading global property information , analytics and data-enabled services provider , has reported that approximately 5.4 million homes , or 10.8 % of all residential properties with a mortgage , were in a negative position as of the end of the fourth quarter 2014. negative equity , often referred to as “ underwater ” or “ upside down , ” means that borrowers owe more on their mortgages than their homes are worth . negative equity can occur because of a decline in value , an increase in mortgage debt or a combination of both . for the homes in negative equity status , the national aggregate value of negative equity was $ 349 billion at the end of the fourth quarter of 2014 , up $ 7 billion from approximately $ 342 billion at the end of the third quarter 2014. in addition , corelogic ® reports that of the 49.9 million residential properties with equity , approximately 10 million have less than 20 % equity . borrowers with less than 20 % equity , referred to as “ under-equitied , ” may have a more difficult time refinancing their existing home or obtaining new financing to sell and buy another home due to 55 underwriting constraints . under-equitied mortgages accounted for 20 % of all residential properties with a mortgage nationwide in the fourth quarter of 2014 , with more than 1.4 million residential properties at less than 5 % equity , referred to as near-negative equity . properties that are near-negative equity are considered at risk if home prices fall . further , a portion of the 800,000 borrowers with low interest rates under the hamp for the past five years will begin seeing mortgage payment increases in 2014. generally , their interest rates will increase by one percentage point each year until their rate equals the average 30-year , fixed-rate mortgage rate at the time of modification . 11 % of hamp borrowers have already missed at least one payment , and we believe that wages and home prices have not improved enough for many of these borrowers to afford the monthly payment increase . in june , september and november 2014 , the fha held note sales under the distressed asset stabilization program of 2014 , or dasp , as part of a broad effort by the fha to decrease losses and market and sell non-performing loans in bulk . further such sales are expected . in addition , in july 2014 and february 2015 , freddie mac sold $ 659 million and $ 392 million , respectively , of non-performing loans , and both fannie mae and freddie mac have indicated that they will have ongoing non-performing loan sales programs going forward . we also believe that banks and other mortgage lenders have strengthened their capital bases and are more aggressively foreclosing on delinquent borrowers or selling these loans to dispose of their inventory . additionally , many non-performing loan buyers are now interested in reducing their investment duration and have begun selling re-performing loans . we also believe there are significant attractive investment opportunities in the smaller commercial mortgage loan and property markets . we focus on densely populated urban areas where we expect positive economic change based on certain demographic , economic and social statistical data . the primary lenders for smaller multi-family and mixed retail/residential properties are community banks and not regional and national banks and large institutional lenders . we believe the primary lenders and loan purchasers are less interested in these assets because they typically require significant commercial and residential mortgage credit and underwriting expertise , special servicing capability and active property management . it is also more difficult to create the large pools that these primary banks , lenders and portfolio acquirers typically desire . many community banks also remain under financial and regulatory pressure since the financial crisis and are now beginning to sell smaller commercial mortgage loans as property values have begun to increase . factors that may affect our operating results acquisitions . our operating results depend heavily on sourcing re-performing and non-performing loans . we believe that there is currently a large supply of re-performing and non-performing loans available to us for acquisition . story_separator_special_tag we describe the securitizations and the repurchase financing facility below under “ — liquidity and capital resources. ” to the extent appropriate at the relevant time , our financing sources may also include bank credit facilities , warehouse lines of credit , structured financing arrangements and additional repurchase agreements , among others . see “ — liquidity and capital resources. ” we may also seek to raise additional capital through public or private offerings of debt or equity securities , depending upon market conditions . to qualify as a reit under the code , we generally will need to distribute at least 90 % of our taxable income each year ( subject to certain adjustments ) to our stockholders . this distribution requirement limits our ability to retain earnings and thereby replenish or increase capital to support our activities . resolution methodologies . we , through the servicer , or our affiliates , employ various loan resolution methodologies with respect to our residential mortgage loans , including loan modification , collateral resolution and collateral disposition . the manner in which a non-performing loan is resolved will affect the 57 amount and timing of revenue we will receive . our preferred resolution methodology is to modify non-performing loans . once successfully modified and there is a period of continued performance , we expect that borrowers will typically refinance these loans with other lenders or facilitated by the servicer at or near the estimated value of the underlying property . we believe modification followed by refinancing generates near-term cash flows , provides the highest possible economic outcome for us and is a socially responsible business strategy because it keeps more families in their homes . in certain circumstances , we may also consider selling these modified loans . though we do not actively seek to acquire reo or rental properties , through historical experience , we expect that many of our non-performing residential mortgage loans will enter into foreclosure or similar proceedings , ultimately becoming reo that we can convert into single-family rental properties that we believe will generate long-term returns for our stockholders . reo property can be converted into single-family rental properties or they may be sold through reo liquidation and short sale processes . we expect the timelines for each of the different processes to vary significantly , and final resolution could take up to 24 months or longer from the loan acquisition date . the exact nature of resolution will depend on a number of factors that are beyond our control , including borrower willingness , property value , availability of refinancing , interest rates , conditions in the financial markets , regulatory environment and other factors . to avoid the 100 % prohibited transaction tax on the sale of dealer property by a reit , we intend to dispose of any asset that may be treated as held “ primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of a trade or business ” by contributing or selling the asset to a trs prior to marketing the asset for sale . the state of the real estate market and home prices will determine proceeds from any sale of real estate . we will opportunistically and on an asset-by-asset basis determine whether to rent any reo we acquire , whether upon foreclosure or otherwise , we may determine to sell such assets if they do not meet our investment criteria . in addition , while we seek to track real estate price trends and estimate the effects of those trends on the valuations of our portfolios of residential mortgage loans , future real estate values are subject to influences beyond our control . generally , rising home prices are expected to positively affect our results . conversely , declining real estate prices are expected to negatively affect our results . conversion to rental property . the key variables that will affect our residential rental revenues over the long-term will be the extent to which we acquire reo , which , in turn , will depend on the amount of our capital invested , average occupancy and rental rates in our owned rental properties . we expect the timeline to convert acquired loans into rental properties will vary significantly by loan , which could result in variations in our revenue and our operating performance from period to period . there are a variety of factors that may inhibit our ability , through the servicer , to foreclose upon a residential mortgage loan and get access to the real property within the time frames we model as part of our valuation process . these factors include , without limitation : state foreclosure timelines and the associated deferrals ( including from litigation ) ; unauthorized occupants of the property ; u.s. federal , state or local legislative action or initiatives designed to provide homeowners with assistance in avoiding residential mortgage loan foreclosures that may delay the foreclosure process ; u.s. federal government programs that require specific procedures to be followed to explore the non-foreclosure outcome of a residential mortgage loan prior to the commencement of a foreclosure proceeding ; and declines in real estate values and high levels of unemployment and underemployment that increase the number of foreclosures and place additional pressure on the already overburdened judicial and administrative systems . expenses . our expenses primarily consist of the fees and expenses payable by us under the management agreement and the servicing agreement . our manager incurs direct , out-of-pocket costs related to managing our business , which are contractually reimbursable by us . depreciation and amortization is a non-cash expense associated with the ownership of real estate and generally remains relatively consistent each year at an asset level since we depreciate our properties on a straight-line basis over a fixed life . interest expense consists of the costs to borrow money . changes in home prices .

"the company determines the cost basis of warrants based upon their respective fair values on the date of receipt in proportion to the total fair value story_separator_special_tag the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k. statements we make in the following discussion which express a belief , expectation or intention , as well as those that are not historical fact , are forward-looking statements that are subject to risks , uncertainties and assumptions . our actual results , performance or achievements , or industry results , could differ materially from those we express in the following discussion as a result of a variety of factors , including the risks and uncertainties we have referred to under the headings “ cautionary statement concerning forward-looking statements ” and “ risk factors ” in part i of this report . overview we are an internally managed closed-end , non-diversified investment company that has been elected to be regulated as a bdc under the 1940 act . we specialize in providing customized debt and equity financing to lmm companies and debt capital to umm companies in a broad range of investment segments located primarily in the united states . our investment objective is to produce attractive risk-adjusted returns by generating current income from our debt investments and capital appreciation from our equity and equity related investments . our investment strategy is to partner with business owners , management teams and financial sponsors to provide flexible financing solutions to fund growth , changes of control , or other corporate events . we invest primarily in senior debt securities , secured by security interests in portfolio company assets . we also invest in equity interests in our portfolio companies alongside our debt securities . we focus on investing in companies with histories of generating revenues and positive cash flow , established market positions and proven management teams with strong operating discipline . we primarily target senior debt and equity investments 46 in lmm companies , as well as first and second lien syndicated loans in umm companies . our target lmm companies typically have annual earnings before interest , taxes , depreciation and amortization ( “ ebitda ” ) between $ 3.0 million and $ 15.0 million , and our lmm investments generally range in size from $ 5.0 million to $ 25.0 million . our umm investments generally include syndicated first and second lien loans in companies with ebitda generally greater than $ 50.0 million , and our umm investments typically range in size from $ 5.0 million to $ 15.0 million . we seek to fill the financing gap for lmm companies , which , historically , have had more limited access to financing from commercial banks and other traditional sources . the underserved nature of the lmm creates the opportunity for us to meet the financing needs of lmm companies while also negotiating favorable transaction terms and equity participations . our ability to invest across a lmm company 's capital structure , from secured loans to equity securities , allows us to offer portfolio companies a comprehensive suite of financing options . providing customized financing solutions is important to lmm companies . we generally seek to partner directly with financial sponsors , entrepreneurs , management teams and business owners in making our investments . our lmm debt investments typically include senior loans with a first lien on the assets of the portfolio company . our lmm debt investments typically have a term of between five and seven years from the original investment date . we also often seek to invest in the equity securities of our lmm portfolio companies . our investments in umm companies primarily consist of direct investments in or secondary purchases of interest bearing debt securities in privately held companies that are generally larger in size than the lmm companies included in our portfolio . our umm debt investments are generally secured by either a first or second priority lien on the assets of the portfolio company and typically have an expected duration of between three and seven years from the original investment date . since the share distribution on september 30 , 2015 through march 31 , 2020 , our exited investments resulted in a weighted average internal rate of return to the company of approximately 16.4 % ( based on original cash invested of approximately $ 227.0 million ) . internal rate of return is the discount rate that makes the net present value of all cash flows related to a particular investment equal to zero . internal rate of return is gross of expenses related to investments as these expenses are not allocable to specific investments . investments are considered to be exited when the original investment objective has been achieved through the receipt of cash and or non-cash consideration upon the repayment of a debt investment or sale of an investment or through the determination that no further consideration was collectible and , thus , a loss may have been realized . approximately 87.4 % of these exited investments resulted in an aggregate cash flow realized internal rate of return to the company of 10 % or greater . because we are internally managed , we do not pay any external investment advisory fees , but instead directly incur the operating costs associated with employing investment and portfolio management professionals . we believe that our internally managed structure provides us with a beneficial operating expense structure when compared to other publicly traded and privately held investment firms which are externally managed , and our internally managed structure allows us the opportunity to leverage our non-interest operating expenses as we grow our investment portfolio . for the years ended march 31 , 2020 , 2019 and 2018 , the ratio of our annualized fourth quarter operating expenses , excluding interest expense , as a percentage of our quarterly average total assets was 2.37 % , 2.81 % and 3.36 % , respectively . story_separator_special_tag in addition , changes in the market environment , portfolio company performance , and other events may occur over the lives of the investments that may cause the gains or losses ultimately realized on these investments to be materially different than the valuations currently assigned . we determine the fair value of each individual investment and record changes in fair value as unrealized appreciation or depreciation . our board of directors is responsible for determining , in good faith , the fair value for our investment portfolio and our valuation procedures , consistent with 1940 act requirements . our board of directors believes that our investment portfolio as of march 31 , 2020 and 2019 reflects fair value as of those dates based on the markets in which we operate and other conditions in existence on those reporting dates . revenue recognition interest and dividend income interest and dividend income is recorded on an accrual basis to the extent amounts are expected to be collected . dividend income is recognized on the date dividends are declared by the portfolio company or at the point an obligation exists for the portfolio company to make a distribution . discounts/premiums received to par on loans purchased are capitalized and accreted or 48 amortized into income over the life of the loan . in accordance with our valuation policy , accrued interest and dividend income is evaluated periodically for collectability . when we do not expect the debtor to be able to service all of its debt or other obligations , we will generally establish a reserve against interest income receivable , thereby placing the loan or debt security on non-accrual status , and cease to recognize interest income on that loan or debt security until the borrower has demonstrated the ability and intent to pay contractual amounts due . if a loan or debt security 's status significantly improves regarding ability to service debt or other obligations , it will be restored to accrual basis . as of march 31 , 2020 , we had four investments on non-accrual status , which comprised of approximately 3.3 % of our total investment portfolio 's fair value and approximately 5.8 % of its cost . as of march 31 , 2019 , we had one investment on non-accrual status , which represented approximately 1.6 % of our total investment portfolio 's fair value and approximately 1.9 % of its cost . recently issued accounting standards in february 2016 , the fasb issued asu 2016-02 , leases , which requires lessees to recognize on the balance sheet a right-of-use asset , representing its right to use the underlying asset for the lease term , and a lease liability for all leases with terms greater than 12 months . the guidance also requires qualitative and quantitative disclosures designed to assess the amount , timing , and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases . the standard requires the use of a modified retrospective transition approach , which includes a number of optional practical expedients that entities may elect to apply . in july 2018 , the fasb issued asu 2018-10 , codification improvements to topic 842 , leases , which affects narrow aspects of the guidance issued in the amendments in asu 2016-02. the new guidance is effective for annual periods beginning after december 15 , 2018 , and interim periods therein . cswc adopted asu 2016-02 effective april 1 , 2019. under asc 842 , leases , ( `` asc 842 '' ) , cswc evaluates leases to determine if the leases are considered financing or operating leases . the company currently has one operating lease for office space for which the company has recorded a right-of-use asset and lease liability for the operating lease obligation . non-lease components ( maintenance , property tax , insurance and parking ) are not included in the lease cost . the lease expense is presented as a single lease cost that is amortized on a straight-line basis over the life of the lease . in august 2018 , the fasb issued asu 2018-13 , fair value measurement ( topic 820 ) : disclosure framework - changes to the disclosure requirements for fair value measurement , which changes the fair value measurement disclosure requirements of asc 820. the key provisions include new , eliminated and modified disclosure requirements . the new guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15 , 2019 , including interim periods therein . early application is permitted . cswc elected to early adopt asu 2018-13 effective april 1 , 2019. no significant changes to the fair value disclosures were necessary in the notes to the consolidated financial statements in order to comply with asu 2018-13. in march 2019 , the sec issued final rule release no . 33-10618 , fast act modernization and simplification of regulation s-k , which amends certain sec disclosure requirements . the amendments are intended to simplify certain disclosure requirements , improve readability and navigability of disclosure documents , and discourage repetition and disclosure of

company for this annual report on form 10-k , there were no significant changes to the company 's consolidated financial position or disclosures . investment portfolio composition our lmm investments consist primarily of secured debt , equity warrants and direct equity investments in privately held , lmm companies based in the united states . our lmm portfolio companies generally have annual ebitda between $ 3.0 million and $ 15.0 million , and our lmm investments typically range in size from $ 5.0 million to $ 25.0 million . the lmm debt investments are typically secured by either a first or second priority lien on the assets of the portfolio company , generally bear interest at floating rates , and generally have a term of between five and seven years from the original investment date .
","results of operations the composite measure of our financial performance in the consolidated statements of operations is captioned “ net increase ( decrease ) in net assets from operations ” and consists of three elements . the first is “ net investment income ( loss ) , ” which is the difference between income from interest , dividends and fees and our combined operating and interest expenses , net of applicable income taxes . the second element is “ net realized gain ( loss ) on investments before income tax , ” which is the difference between the proceeds received from the disposition of portfolio securities and their stated cost . the third element is the “ net change in unrealized appreciation on investments , net of tax ” which is the net change in the market or fair value of our investment portfolio , compared with stated cost . it should be noted that the “ net realized gain ( loss ) on investments before income tax ” and “ net change in unrealized appreciation on investments , net of tax ” are directly related in that when an appreciated portfolio security is sold to realize a gain , a corresponding decrease in net unrealized appreciation occurs by transferring the gain associated with the transaction from being “ unrealized ” to being “ realized. ” conversely , when a loss is realized on a depreciated portfolio security , an increase in net unrealized appreciation occurs .

covid-19 virus on our business in march 2020 , the world health organization declared the outbreak of a novel coronavirus ( “ covid-19 ” ) as a pandemic and the united states declared a national public health emergency . as a result , public health measures were taken to minimize exposure to the virus . these measures , some of which are government-mandated , were implemented globally resulting in a dramatic decrease in economic activity . “ stay-at-home ” orders with the exception of conducting certain essential functions , quarantines , travel restrictions and other governmental restrictions to reduce the spread of covid-19 have had an adverse impact on our company 's business . from mid-march through april , all of our company-owned restaurants operated on a take-away , mobile pick-up and delivery basis only in order to protect its employees and customers from the spread of the covid-19 pandemic and to comply with the government mandates . beginning in may , we gradually began opening our restaurants for dine-in at 25 % to 50 % capacity pursuant to the regulations of the jurisdictions in which we operate . while all but one of our company-owned restaurants began operating under limited-capacity in-store dining by mid-june 2020 , in late october , some locations were required to reduce or eliminate in-store dining due to new covid restrictions ( note 1 nature of business and significant accounting policies ) . due to the rapid development and fluidity of this situation , we can not determine the ultimate impact that the covid-19 pandemic will have on our consolidated financial condition , liquidity , and future results of operations . fiscal year our fiscal year ends on the sunday nearest to december 31st of each year . our fiscal year is generally 52 weeks ; however , it periodically consists of 53 weeks . the fiscal year ended january 3 , 2021 ( fiscal 2020 ) consisted of 53 weeks while the fiscal year ended december 29 , 2019 (

subsidiaries . all intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation . certain reclassifications have been made to prior year amounts to conform to the current year 's presentation . application of critical accounting policies and estimates the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our financial statements , which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states . the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets , liabilities and expenses , and related disclosures . on an on-going basis , management evaluates its estimates and judgments . by their nature , these estimates and judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty . management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience , observance of trends in the industry , information provided by customers and other outside sources and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances , the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources . actual results may differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions . our management believes the following critical accounting policies reflect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements . our company 's significant accounting policies are described in note 1 nature of business and significant accounting policies to the consolidated financial statements included herein . story_separator_special_tag we review annually these liquor licenses for impairment . additionally , the costs of obtaining non-transferable liquor licenses that are directly issued by local government agencies for nominal fees are expensed as incurred . annual liquor license renewal fees are recognized in expense over the renewal term . accounts receivable , net we provide an allowance for uncollectible accounts on accounts receivable based on historical losses and existing economic conditions , when relevant . we provide for a general bad debt reserve for franchise receivables due to increases in days sales outstanding for which no payment plan or other payment arrangement exists . this general reserve is based on the aging of receivables meeting specified criteria and is adjusted each quarter based on past due receivable balances . additionally , we have periodically established a specific reserve on certain receivables as necessary on a case-by-case basis . any changes to the reserve are recorded in general and administrative expenses . in fiscal 2020 , we recorded approximately $ 403,000 in bad debt related to the discount we offered franchisees on deferred payments remitted prior to june 30 , 2020 as described in note 1 nature of business and significant accounting policies to the financial statements . exclusive of that one-time adjustment , accounts receivable balances written off have not exceeded allowances provided . we believe all accounts receivable in excess of the allowance are fully collectible . if accounts receivable in excess of provided allowances are determined uncollectible , they are charged to expense in the period that 30 determination is made . in assessing recoverability of these receivables , we make judgments regarding the financial condition of the franchisees based primarily on past and current payment trends , as well as other variables , including annual financial information , which franchisees are required to submit to us . stock-based compensation beginning in fiscal 2019 , we were required to adopt asu 2018-17- compensation – stock compensation ( topic 718 ) : improvements to nonemployee

allowable tax credits for items such as taxes paid on reported tip income , estimates related to depreciation and amortization expense allowable for tax purposes , and the tax deductibility of certain other items . our estimates are based on the information available to us at the time that we prepare the income tax provision . we generally file our annual income tax returns several months after our fiscal year-end . income tax returns are subject to audit by federal , state , and local governments , generally years after the tax returns are filed . these returns could be subject to material adjustments or differing interpretations of the tax laws . accounting for uncertain tax positions requires significant judgment including estimating the amount , timing , and likelihood of ultimate settlement . although we believe that our estimates are reasonable , actual results could differ from these estimates . additionally , uncertain positions may be re-measured as warranted by changes in facts or law . results of operations – fiscal year 2020 compared to fiscal year 2019 the following table presents items in our consolidated statements of operations as a percentage of net restaurant

result of the covid-19 pandemic . catering same store sales decreased 54.6 % for fiscal year 2020 compared to fiscal year 2019 as a result of group activities being eliminated or reduced in capacity as a result of the covid-19 pandemic . we have been making significant investments in programs aimed at increasing to-go and catering sales at all our bbq holdings restaurants . we have rolled out delivery programs with various third-party services , which we believe , along with online ordering , will continue to augment our to-go and catering sales in the future .

allocation of facility and information technology costs and other overhead costs . story_separator_special_tag we believe that once these government measures are lifted or relaxed , demand will begin to slowly return . in response to the global covid-19 pandemic , we mobilized our research and development teams in order to bring to market covid-19 antibody and antigen tests . we have received a combination of emergency use authorization from the fda , authority to affix a ce mark for sale in the european union and various other regulatory approvals globally for our covid-19 antibody and antigen tests . we continue to work on gaining further regulatory approvals to sell the tests in other markets worldwide . our covid-19 antibody tests detect whether a patient has been previously infected by covid-19 and our covid-19 antigen test detects whether a patient is currently infected by covid-19 . all three of our covid-19 antibody and antigen tests run on our existing instruments . we are continually monitoring our business continuity plans due to the global covid-19 pandemic . due to the fact that our products and services are considered to be medically critical , our manufacturing and research and development sites are generally exempt from governmental orders in the united states and other countries requiring businesses to cease operations . for these sites , we have taken steps to protect our employees , and the majority of our office-based work is being conducted remotely . we have also implemented strict travel restrictions , which has reduced our travel-related operating expenses . as the global covid-19 pandemic is an ongoing matter , our future assessment of the magnitude and duration of the covid-19 pandemic , as well as other factors , could result in material impacts to our consolidated financial statements in future reporting periods . results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the information contained in the accompanying consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k. our historical results of operations may not necessarily reflect what will occur in the future . fiscal year ended january 3 , 2021 compared with fiscal year ended december 29 , 2019 overview of results during the fiscal year ended january 3 , 2021 , reported net loss of $ 211.9 million increased by $ 55.0 million compared with the fiscal year ended december 29 , 2019. our results were materially impacted by the global covid-19 pandemic , as net revenue for the fiscal year ended january 3 , 2021 decreased by $ 35.3 million compared with the fiscal year ended december 29 , 2019. this decrease included operational net revenue declines of 1.3 % and a negative impact of 0.7 % from foreign currency fluctuations . we also incurred higher idle or underutilized facilities costs , higher freight costs and higher distribution costs , which were partially offset by cost containment measures to incur lower employee-related costs and lower travel-related costs . our results were also affected by a research and development upfront payment of $ 7.5 million , higher foreign currency losses , primarily unrealized , and losses on early extinguishment of our 2022 notes , partially offset by lower interest expense . net revenue net revenue for the fiscal year ended january 3 , 2021 decreased by $ 35.3 million , or 2.0 % , compared with the fiscal year ended december 29 , 2019. net revenue for the fiscal year ended january 3 , 2021 included operational net revenue declines of 1.3 % and a negative impact of 0.7 % from foreign currency fluctuations , which was primarily driven by the strengthening of the u.s. dollar against a variety of currencies . the decrease in net revenue for the fiscal year ended january 3 , 2021 , excluding the impact of foreign currency 61 exchange , was mainly driven by l ower revenues in our clinical laboratories business in the emea , greater china and other regions due primarily to the global covid-19 pandemic and lower local hcv revenue in the japan region of approximately $ 18 million , as well as lower revenues in our transfusion medicine business in all regions due primarily to the global covid-19 pandemic . these decreases were partially offset by increases in our clinical laboratories business in the north america region related to sales of our covid-19 antibody tests and other assays , instrument sales and grant revenue related to development of our covid-19 antibody and antigen tests . the decrease in net revenue was also impacted by lower other product revenue due to the reduction and timing of certain performance obligations in a contract manufacturing arrangement . the following table shows total net revenue by line of business : replace_table_token_4_th core revenue clinical laboratories revenue for the fiscal year ended january 3 , 2021 increased by $ 11.9 million , or 1.0 % , compared with the fiscal year ended december 29 , 2019. this increase included operational net revenue gains of 2.3 % partially offset by a negative impact of 1.2 % from foreign currency fluctuations . clinical laboratories revenue increased in the north america region related to sales of our covid-19 antibody tests and other assays , instrument sales and grant revenue related to development of our covid-19 antibody and antigen tests . these increases were offset by lower revenues in the emea , greater china and other regions due primarily to decreased shipments to customers as a result of the global covid-19 pandemic and lower local hcv revenue in the japan region of approximately $ 18 million . transfusion medicine revenue for the fiscal year ended january 3 , 2021 decreased by $ 17.4 million , or 2.9 % , compared with the fiscal year ended december 29 , 2019. this decrease included operational net revenue declines of 3.3 % partially offset by a positive impact of 0.3 % from foreign currency fluctuations . the decrease in transfusion medicine revenue was primarily due to decreased shipments to customers in all regions as a result of the global covid-19 pandemic . non-core revenue other product revenue for the fiscal year ended january 3 , 2021 decreased by $ 28.8
","segment results the key indicators that we monitor are as follows : net revenue - this measure is discussed in the section entitled “ results of operations ; ” 68 management ebitda — management ebitda by reportable segment is used by our management to measure and evaluate the internal operating performance of our segments . it is also the basis for calculating certain management incentive compensation programs . management ebitda is our adjusted ebitda further adjusted for other items including realized foreign currency gains and losses , impact from adoption of accounting standards , costs in connection with covid-19 and other immaterial management adjustments . we believe that this measurement is useful to investors as a way to analyze the underlying trends in our core business , including at the segment level , consistently across the periods presented and also to evaluate performance under management incentive compensation programs . in the fiscal year ended january 3 , 2021 we changed the methodology in which certain manufacturing expenses were allocated between corporate and the reportable segments . as a result of the change in methodology , we have revised the management ebitda results by segment for the fiscal years ended december 29 , 2019 and december 30 , 2018 in order to provide comparable information for all periods presented .

david g. gaw director april 15 , 2014 david g. gaw story_separator_special_tag the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes that appear elsewhere in this document . overview we are a maryland corporation and qualified as a reit beginning with the tax year ending december 31 , 2012. on march 24 , 2011 , we filed a registration statement on form s-11 with the sec to offer a minimum of 250,000 shares of our common stock and a maximum 65,000,000 shares for sale to the public , of which 50,000,000 were registered in our primary offering and 15,000,000 were registered under our dividend reinvestment plan . the sec declared our registration statement effective on november 1 , 2011 , and we retained plymouth real estate capital , an affiliate of our advisor , to act as the dealer manager of the offering . the dealer manager is responsible for marketing our shares in our initial offering . 17 on january 9 , 2014 , at the recommendation of our advisor , and following the approval of our board of directors , the company terminated its initial public offering effective as of may 6 , 2014. in conjunction with the termination of the initial public offering , our board of directors also voted to terminate our distribution reinvestment plan and our share redemption plan effective may 6 , 2014. on january 9 , 2014 , our board of directors authorized our advisor to negotiate an engagement letter with a nationally recognized investment bank for financial advisory services in connection with pursuing strategic alternatives for the company , including a possible listed public offering . the company can provide no assurances that it will actually enter into an engagement letter or be able to effect any strategic alternatives . we intend to use substantially all of the proceeds from our initial offering to acquire and operate a diverse portfolio of commercial real estate assets that are expected to provide consistent current income and may also provide capital appreciation resulting from our expectation that in certain circumstances we will be able to acquire properties at a discount to replacement cost or otherwise less than the anticipated market value or to expend capital to reposition or redevelop a property so as to increase its value over the amount of cash we paid to acquire and rehabilitate the property . in particular , we plan to diversify our portfolio by property type , geographic region , investment size and investment risk with the goal of acquiring a portfolio of income producing real estate properties and real estate related assets that provide attractive returns for our stockholders . we intend to primarily acquire , or participate in joint ventures owning , a wide variety of commercial properties , including office , industrial , retail , hospitality , medical office , single-tenant , multifamily , student housing and other real properties , including raw land . these properties are initially expected to be existing , income-producing properties ; additionally , we may invest in newly constructed properties or properties under development or construction . in addition , given the then existing economic conditions and subject to applicable reit requirements , our investment strategy may also include investments in real estate-related assets such as mortgage , mezzanine , bridge and other loans and debt and equity securities issued by other real estate companies ; however , we intend to limit these types of investments so that neither the company nor any of its subsidiaries will meet the definition of an `` investment company '' under the investment company act . story_separator_special_tag the third is 5400 fulton industrial boulevard , a warehouse facility , containing 682,750 square feet in atlanta , georgia . our cash needs for these acquisitions were met with the proceeds of our initial offering . operating cash needs during the same period were also met with proceeds from our initial offering . proceeds from our initial offering will continue to be applied to investments in properties and the payment or reimbursement of selling commissions and other fees and expenses related to our initial offering . we will experience a relative increase in liquidity as we receive additional subscriptions for shares and a relative decrease in liquidity as we spend net offering proceeds in connection with the acquisition and operation of our properties or the payment of distributions . 19 the number of properties and other assets that we will acquire will depend upon the number of shares sold and the resulting amount of the net proceeds available for investment in properties and other assets . until required for the acquisition or operation of assets or use for distributions , we will keep the net proceeds of our initial offering in short-term , low-risk , highly liquid , interest-bearing investments . we intend to make reserve allocations as necessary to aid our objective of preserving capital for our investors by supporting the maintenance and viability of properties we acquire in the future . if reserves and any other available income become insufficient to cover our operating expenses and liabilities , it may be necessary to obtain additional funds by borrowing , refinancing properties or liquidating our investment in one or more properties . there is no assurance that such funds will be available , or if available , that the terms will be acceptable to us . our principal demands for cash are for acquisition costs , including the purchase price of the assets we acquire , improvement costs , the payment of our operating and administrative expenses and distributions to our stockholders . generally , we fund our acquisitions from the net proceeds of our initial offering . we intend to acquire our assets with cash and mortgage or other debt , but we also may acquire assets free and clear of permanent mortgage or other indebtedness by paying the entire purchase price for the asset in cash or in units issued by our operating partnership . as of april 15 , 2014 , we had gross offering proceeds of approximately $ 11.246 million . if we are unable to raise substantially more funds in our initial offering than the minimum offering amount , we will make fewer investments resulting in less diversification in terms of the type , number and size of investments we make and the value of an investment in us will fluctuate with the performance of the specific assets we acquire . further , we will have certain fixed operating expenses , including certain expenses as a publicly offered reit , regardless of whether we are able to raise substantial funds in our initial offering . our inability to raise substantial funds would increase our fixed operating expenses as a percentage of gross income , reducing our net income and limiting our ability to make distributions . we do not expect to establish a permanent reserve from our offering proceeds for maintenance and repairs of real properties , as we expect the vast majority of leases for the properties we acquire will provide for tenant reimbursement of operating expenses . however , to the extent that we have insufficient funds for such purposes , we may establish reserves from gross offering proceeds , out of cash flow from operations or net cash proceeds from the sale of properties . in addition to making investments in accordance with our investment objectives , we also use our capital resources to make certain payments to our advisor and dealer manager . during our organization and offering stage , these payments include payments to our dealer manager for selling commissions and payments to our advisor for reimbursement of certain organization and offering expenses . however , our advisor has agreed to reimburse us to the extent that selling commissions and other organization and offering expenses incurred by us exceed 15 % of our gross offering proceeds . during our acquisition and development stage , we expect to make payments to our advisor in connection with the selection and origination or purchase of real estate investments , the management of our assets and costs incurred by our advisor in providing services to us . the advisory agreement has a one-year term but may be renewed for an unlimited number of successive one-year periods upon the mutual consent of our advisor and our corporate governance committee . the company has operated in a manner that allows it to qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes . the company filed its initial form 1120-reit as its tax return for the tax year ended december 31 , 2012. to maintain our qualification as a reit , we are required to make aggregate annual distributions to our stockholders of at least 90 % of our reit taxable income ( computed without regard to the dividends-paid deduction and excluding net capital gains ) . our board of directors may authorize distributions in excess of those required for us to maintain reit status depending on our financial condition and such other factors as our board of directors deems relevant . provided we have sufficient available cash flow , we intend to authorize and declare distributions based on daily record dates and pay distributions on a quarterly basis . we have not established a minimum distribution level . the company incurred net losses of $ 3,472,224 and $ 2,166,678 for the years ended december 31 , 2013 and 2012 , respectively . at december 31 , 2013 the company had cash of $ 265,952 and had no debt outstanding and no obligation to fund

management company and owner of a diversified portfolio of approximately 30 global consumer brands across our operating segments : women 's , men 's , home , and international . our business strategy

related to our brands throughout the world and in all relevant categories by licensing directly with leading retailers ( “ direct-to-retail ” or “ dtr ” ) , through a consortia of wholesale licensees , through joint ventures in specific territories and via other activity such as corporate sponsorships and content as well as the sale of ip for specific categories or territories . products bearing our brands are sold across a variety of distribution channels . the licensees are generally responsible for designing , manufacturing and distributing the licensed products . we support our brands with marketing , advertising and promotional campaigns designed to increase brand awareness . additionally , we provide our licensees with coordinated trend direction to enhance product appeal and help build and maintain brand integrity . globally , we have over 60 dtr licenses and more than 450 total licenses . licensees are selected based upon our belief that such licensees will be able to produce and sell quality products in the categories of their specific expertise and that they are capable of exceeding minimum sales targets and royalties that we generally require for each brand . this licensing strategy is designed to permit us to operate our licensing business and leverage our core competencies of marketing and brand management with minimal working capital . the majority of our licensing agreements include minimum guaranteed royalty revenue which provides us with greater visibility into future cash flows . as of january 1 , 2021 , we had approximately $ 381 million of

time , we are uncertain how the terms and conditions of any potential replacement licensing arrangements could affect our future revenues and cash flows . we identify our operating segments according to how business activities are managed and evaluated . we have four distinct reportable operating segments : women 's , men 's , home , and international . the four reportable operating segments represent our 27 activities for which separate financial information is available and which is utilized on a regular basis by the chief executive officer in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance . since we do not track , manage and analyze our assets by segments , no disclosure of segmented assets is reported . our segments consist of the following : women 's segment –

in managing our business . our chief executive officer has been identified as the chief operating decision maker . our measures of segment profitability are licensing revenue and operating income . story_separator_special_tag operating activities net cash provided by operating activities decreased approximately $ 9.9 million , from $ 30.3 million in fy 2019 to $ 20.4 million in fy 2020 primarily

agreement , we received $ 17.7 million in cash and the remaining balance of $ 7.3 million was recognized as a reduction to our debt obligation to novartis . takeda in november 2020 , the first patient was dosed in takeda 's phase 2 study of mezagitamab , and we earned a $ 2.0 million milestone payment from takeda pursuant to our takeda collaboration agreement . rezolute 47 ​ in december 2017 , we entered into a license and common stock purchase agreement with rezolute , which was amended on march 30 , 2018 and further amended on january 7 , 2019. the license agreement was amended to eliminate the requirement that equity securities be issued to us upon the closing of the qualified financing ( as defined in the license agreement ) and to replace it with a requirement that rezolute : ( 1 ) make five cash payments to us totaling $ 8.5 million following the closing of a qualified financing on or before specified staggered future dates through september 2020 ( the “ future cash payments ” ) ; and ( 2 ) provide for early payment of the future cash payments ( only until $ 8.5 million was reached ) by making cash payments to us equal to 15 % of the net proceeds of each future financing following the closing of the qualified financing , with such payments to be credited against any remaining unpaid future cash payments in reverse order of their future payment date . the common stock purchase agreement was amended to remove certain provisions related to the issuance of equity to us in accordance with the new provisions regarding the future cash payments in the license agreement . ​ on march 31 , 2020 , we and rezolute further amended the license agreement to extend the payment schedule for the remaining $ 2.6 million in future cash payments . the amendment to the payment terms was in response to rezolute 's need to preserve cash as a result of the covid-19 pandemic and was agreed to by us . the revised payment schedule did not impact the total amount due , but instead , spread the $ 2.6 million into seven quarterly payments to be paid through september 30 , 2021. the amended license agreement required that in the event rezolute completed a qualified financing at any time between march 31 , 2020 and the date of the final payment , rezolute would pay all amounts outstanding within fifteen days following the closing of the qualified financing . in the first quarter of 2020 , we received the scheduled $ 0.4 million future cash payment from rezolute . story_separator_special_tag all licenses we grant to customers are unique , as each uses a specific technology of xoma or is geared towards a specific unique product candidate . thus , there is no observable evidence of standalone selling price for the licenses . the standalone selling price is generally determined using a valuation approach based on discounted cash flow analysis . for licenses that are bundled with other promises , we utilize judgement to assess the nature of the combined performance obligation to determine whether the combined performance obligation is satisfied over time or at a point in time . under our license agreements , the nature of the combined performance obligation is the granting of licenses to the customers . as such , we recognize revenue related to the combined performance obligation upon transfer of the license to the customers or completion of the transfer of related materials and services ( i.e. , point in time ) . sale of future revenue streams we have sold our rights to receive certain milestones and royalties on product sales . in the circumstance where we have sold our rights to future milestones and royalties under a license agreement and also maintain limited continuing involvement in the arrangement ( but not significant continuing involvement in the generation of the cash flows that are due to the purchaser ) , we defer recognition of the proceeds we received for the sale of milestone or royalty streams and recognize such unearned revenue as revenue under the units-of-revenue method over the life of the underlying license agreement . under the units-of-revenue method , amortization for a reporting period is calculated by computing a ratio of 49 the proceeds received from the purchaser to the total payments expected to be made to the purchaser over the term of the agreement , and then applying that ratio to the period 's cash payment . estimating the total payments expected to be received by the purchaser over the term of such arrangements requires management to use subjective estimates and assumptions . changes to our estimate of the payments expected to be made to the purchaser over the term of such arrangements could have a material effect on the amount of revenues recognized in any particular period . stock-based compensation stock-based compensation expense for stock options and other stock awards is estimated at the grant date based on the award 's fair value-based measurement . the valuation of stock-based compensation awards is determined at the date of grant using the black-scholes option pricing model ( the “ black-scholes model ” ) . this model requires highly complex and subjective inputs , such as the expected term of the option and expected volatility . these inputs are subjective and generally require significant analysis and judgment to develop . our current estimate of volatility is based on the historical volatility of our stock price . to the extent volatility in our stock price increases in the future , our estimates of the fair value of options granted in the future could increase , thereby increasing stock-based compensation cost recognized in future periods . to establish an estimate of expected term , we consider the vesting period and contractual period of the award and our historical experience of stock option exercises , post-vesting cancellations and volatility . the risk-free rate is based on the yield available on united states treasury zero-coupon issues . forfeitures are recognized as they occur . we review our valuation assumptions quarterly and , as a result , we likely will update our valuation assumptions used to value stock-based awards granted in future periods utilizing current data . in the future , as additional empirical evidence regarding these input estimates becomes available , we may change or refine our approach of deriving these input estimates . these changes could impact our fair value-based measurement of stock options granted in the future . changes in the fair value-based measurement of stock awards could materially impact our operating results . for our stock options and service-based awards , we recognize compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the award 's vesting period . purchase of rights to future milestones and royalties we have purchased rights to receive a portion of certain future developmental , regulatory and commercial sales milestones , and royalties on sales of products currently in clinical development . we acquired such rights from various entities and recorded the amount paid for these rights as long-term royalty receivables . we have accounted for the purchased rights as a financial asset in accordance with asc 310 , receivables . we account for milestone and royalty rights related to developmental pipeline products on a non-accrual basis using the cost recovery method . these developmental pipeline products are non-commercialized , non-approved products that require fda or other regulatory approval , and thus have uncertain cash flows . the related receivable balance is classified as noncurrent since no payments are probable to be received in the near term . under the cost recovery method , any milestone or royalty received is recorded as a direct reduction of the recorded receivable balance . when the recorded receivable balance has been fully collected , any additional amounts collected are recognized as revenue . we review public information on clinical trials , press releases and updates from our partners regularly to identify any impairment indicators or changes in expected recoverability of the long-term receivable asset . if expected future cash flows discounted to the current period are less than the carrying value of the asset , we will record impairment . the impairment will be recognized by reducing the financial asset to an amount that represents the present value of the most recent estimate of cash flows . no impairment was recorded as of december 31 , 2020 .
","results of operations revenues total revenues for the years ended december 31 , 2020 , and 2019 were as follows ( in thousands ) : ​ replace_table_token_3_th ​ revenue from contracts with customers revenue from contracts with customers includes upfront fees , milestone payments and royalties related to the out-licensing of our product candidates and technologies . the primary components of revenue from contracts with customers in 2020 was $ 25.0 million in milestone revenue earned under our anti-tgfβ antibody license agreement with novartis international and $ 2.0 million earned under our collaboration agreement with takeda . the primary components of revenue from contracts with customers in 2019 was $ 14.0 million recognized under our license agreement and common stock purchase agreement with rezolute and $ 2.5 million in revenue earned from a one-time payment under our license agreement with janssen . the generation of future revenues related to licenses , milestones , and royalties is dependent on the achievement of milestones or product sales by our existing licensees . due to the anticipated impact of covid-19 on clinical trial activities of our licensees , potential milestone payments may be delayed . revenue recognized under units-of-revenue method revenues recognized under the units-of-revenue method include the amortization of unearned revenue from the sale of royalty interests to healthcare royalty partners ii , l.p ( “ hcrp ” ) in 2016. the increase in 2020 compared with 2019 was due to increased sales of products underlying the agreements with hcrp . the generation of future revenues related to licenses , milestones , and royalties is dependent on the achievement of milestones or product sales by our existing licensees . milestone payments earned in 2020 are not indicative of anticipated milestones in future periods .

risks and uncertainties and should be read together with the “ risk factors ” section of this annual report on form 10-k for a discussion of important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis . overview we are a biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of innovative therapies for diseases and conditions of the eye using our proprietary hydrogel platform technology . our bioresorbable hydrogel-based drug product candidates are designed to provide extended delivery of therapeutic agents to the eye . our lead product candidates are dextenza ( dexamethasone insert ) , for the treatment of post-surgical ocular inflammation and pain , allergic conjunctivitis and dry eye disease , and otx-tp for the treatment of glaucoma and ocular hypertension , which are extended-delivery , drug-eluting inserts that are placed into the canaliculus through a natural opening called the punctum located in the inner portion of the eyelid near the nose . our intracanalicular inserts combine our hydrogel technology with u.s. food and drug administration , or fda , approved therapeutic agents with the goal of providing extended delivery of drug to the eye . we also have an intravitreal hydrogel depot which is in preclinical development for the treatment of diseases and conditions of the back of the eye including wet age-related macular degeneration , or wet amd . our initial development efforts are focused on the use of our hydrogel depot in combination with anti-angiogenic drugs , such as protein-based anti-vegf drugs or small molecule drugs , such as tyrosine kinase inhibitors , or tkis . our intravitreal depot is designed to be delivered via injection to release therapeutic agents , such as antibodies to vascular endothelial growth factor , or vegf , over an extended period . we have entered into a collaboration , option and license with regeneron pharmaceuticals , inc. , or regeneron , for the development and potential commercialization of products containing our extended-delivery hydrogel depot in combination with regeneron 's large molecule vegf-targeting compounds , with the initial focus on the vegf trap aflibercept , currently marketed under the brand name eylea . in addition to our ongoing product development , we currently market our first commercial product , resure sealant , a hydrogel-based ophthalmic wound sealant approved by the fda to seal corneal incisions following cataract surgery . resure sealant is the first and only surgical sealant to be approved by the fda for ophthalmic use . dextenza our most advanced product candidate , dextenza , incorporates the fda-approved corticosteroid dexamethasone as an active pharmaceutical ingredient into a hydrogel-based drug-eluting insert for intracanalicular use . in september 2015 , we submitted to the fda a new drug application , or nda , for dextenza for the treatment of post-surgical ocular pain . on july 25 , 2016 , we announced that we had received a complete response letter , or crl , from the fda regarding our nda for dextenza . on january 23 , 2017 , we announced that we had resubmitted our nda . on february 22 , 2017 , we announced that the fda accepted for review our nda resubmission . the fda determined that our nda resubmission is a complete response and designated the nda resubmission as a class 2 , or major , review with a target action date under the prescription drug user fee act , or pdufa , of july 19 , 2017. we have completed three phase 3 clinical trials of dextenza for the treatment of post-surgical ocular inflammation and pain . the data from these three completed phase 3 clinical trials and a prior phase 2 clinical trial are being used to support our nda for post-surgical ocular pain . subject to receiving approval for the pain indication pursuant to our nda , we plan to submit an nda supplement , or snda , for dextenza for the treatment of post-surgical ocular inflammation . we have also completed two phase 3 clinical trials of dextenza for the treatment of allergic conjunctivitis . in october 2015 , we announced topline results of our first phase 3 clinical trial for allergic conjunctivitis , and in june 2016 we announced topline results of our second phase 3 clinical trial for this indication . finally , dextenza is in phase 2 clinical development for the treatment of dry eye disease . we announced topline results from an exploratory phase 2 clinical trial for this indication in december 2015. we are assessing our plans for our dry eye program going forward and may focus future efforts on an intracanalicular insert containing an immunosuppressant drug . story_separator_special_tag we anticipate that our operating expenses will increase substantially as we pursue the clinical development of our most advanced product candidates , dextenza and otx-tp , continue the research and development of our other product candidates , continue the internal development of our intravitreal hydrogel depot for the sustained delivery of protein-based or small molecule anti-angiogenic drugs , such as anti-vegf drugs for the treatment of wet amd and other back-of-the-eye diseases and seek marketing approval for any such product candidate for which we obtain favorable pivotal clinical trial results . we expect to continue to incur substantial additional expenses for product manufacturing , sales , marketing and distribution for our product candidates for which we obtain marketing approval . we do not expect to generate significant revenue from sales of any product for several years , if at all . accordingly , we may need to obtain substantial additional funding in connection with our continuing operations . if we are unable to access our borrowing capacity or raise capital when needed or on attractive terms , we could be forced to delay , reduce or eliminate our research and development programs or any future commercialization efforts or to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies , future revenue streams , research programs or product candidates or grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us . in july 2014 , we completed an initial public offering , or ipo , of our common stock , and in august 2014 the underwriters in our ipo exercised their over-allotment option in full . we received total net proceeds of approximately $ 66.4 million from the issuance and sale of 5,750,000 shares of common stock , including in connection with the exercise by the underwriters of their over-allotment option , after deducting underwriting discounts and offering costs . in june 2015 , we completed a follow-on offering of our common stock at a public offering price of $ 22.00 per share . the offering consisted of 4,600,000 shares of common stock , of which 3,200,000 shares were issued and sold by us and 1,400,000 shares were sold by certain of our stockholders , including those shares sold in connection with the exercise by the underwriters of their option to purchase additional shares . we received net proceeds from the follow-on offering of approximately $ 65.6 million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses . in november 2016 , we entered into an at-the-market sales agreement , or the 2016 atm agreement with cantor fitzgerald & co. , or cantor , under which we may offer and sell our common stock having aggregate proceeds of up to $ 40.0 million from time to time . as of february 28 , 2017 , we have sold 263,418 shares of common stock under the 2016 atm agreement at a weighted average exercise price of $ 8.87 per share resulting in net proceeds of approximately $ 2.0 million after underwriting discounts , commission and other offering expenses . in january 2017 , we completed a follow-on offering of our common stock at a public offering price of $ 7.00 per share . the offering consisted of 3,571,429 shares of common stock sold by us . we received net proceeds from the follow-on offering of approximately $ 23.5 million after deducting underwriting discounts expenses . we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities , will enable us to fund our operating expenses , debt service obligations and capital expenditure requirements into the second quarter of 2018. we will need to obtain additional capital to the support the planned commercial launch of dextenza , subject to fda approval . see “ —liquidity and capital resources. ” 118 financial operations overview revenue from our inception through december 31 , 2016 , we have generated limited amounts of revenue from the sales of our products . our resure sealant product received premarket approval , or pma , from the fda in january 2014. we commenced sales of resure sealant in the first quarter of 2014 , have received only limited revenues from resure sealant to date and anticipate only limited sales for 2017. resure sealant is currently our only source of revenue from product sales . we may generate revenue in the future if we successfully develop one or more of our product candidates and receive marketing approval for any such product candidate or if we enter into longer-term collaboration agreements with third parties . in september 2013 , we entered into a feasibility agreement with a biopharmaceutical company relating to our intravitreal drug delivery depot . under this agreement , the biopharmaceutical company agreed to pay us up to $ 0.5 million under this feasibility study . in the event that the agreement was terminated in advance of the achievement of certain milestones , we would have been required to refund certain portions of the funding based on the actual work completed or milestones achieved as of the date of termination . in the fourth quarter of 2014 , the company completed the task related to the first milestone at which time the $ 0.3 million became non-refundable . the biopharmaceutical company has indicated that they will not proceed with the second phase of the agreement . the company does not have any further obligations in connection with this agreement . we entered into a feasibility agreement with a biotechnology company relating to our intravitreal drug delivery depot in october 2014. under this agreement , the biotechnology company had agreed to pay us up to $ 0.7 million , of which $ 0.3 million was a non-refundable up-front payment due upon contract execution and $ 0.4 million will be due upon the achievement of certain milestones . initially , we were recognizing the non-refundable , non-contingent up-front payment of $ 0.3 million as revenue on a straight-line basis over the twelve-month period in which we are expected to complete our performance obligations .

part ii , item 7 of the company 's annual report on form 10-k for the fiscal year ended december 31 , 2019 , filed on march 16 , 2020. overview altus midstream company ( the company or altus ) , through its ownership interest in altus midstream lp ( altus midstream ) , owns gas gathering , processing , and transmission assets in the permian basin of west texas , anchored by midstream service agreements to service apache corporation 's ( apache ) production from its alpine high resource play and surrounding areas ( alpine high ) . additionally , the company owns equity interests in four intrastate permian basin pipelines ( the equity method interest pipelines ) that have access to various points along the texas gulf coast . the company 's operations consist of one reportable segment . the company has no independent operations or material assets outside its ownership interest in altus midstream , which is reported on a consolidated basis . as of december 31 , 2020 , altus midstream 's assets included approximately 182 miles of in-service natural gas gathering pipelines , approximately 46 miles of residue gas pipelines with four market connections , and approximately 38 miles of ngl pipelines . three cryogenic processing trains , each with nameplate capacity of 200 mmcf/d , were placed into service during 2019. other assets include an ngl truck loading terminal with six lease automatic custody transfer units and eight ngl bullet tanks with 90,000 gallon capacity per tank . the company 's existing gathering , processing , and transmission infrastructure is expected to provide capacity levels capable of fulfilling its midstream contracts to service apache 's production from alpine high and potential third-party customers . as of december 31 , 2020 , the company owns the following equity method interest pipelines : a 16 percent equity interest in the gulf coast express pipeline project ( gcx ) , which is owned and operated by kinder morgan texas pipeline , llc ( kinder morgan ) . gcx transports natural gas from the waha area in west texas to agua dulce near the texas gulf coast . gcx was placed in service during 2019 , with the total capacity of 2.0 bcf/d fully subscribed under long-term contracts . a 15 percent equity interest in the epic crude oil pipeline ( epic ) , which is operated by epic consolidated operations , llc . epic transports crude oil from orla , texas in northern reeves county to the port of corpus christi , texas . epic was placed in service early 2020 , with initial throughput capacity of approximately 600 mbbl/d . an approximate 26.7 percent equity interest in the permian highway pipeline ( php ) , which is also owned and operated by kinder morgan . php transports natural gas from the waha area in northern pecos county , texas to the katy , texas area with connections to texas gulf coast and mexico markets . php was placed in service january 2021 , with the total capacity of 2.1 bcf/d fully subscribed under long-term contracts . a 33 percent equity interest in the shin oak ngl pipeline ( shin oak ) , which is owned by breviloba , llc , and operated by enterprise products operating llc . shin oak transports ngls from the permian basin to mont belvieu , texas . shin oak was placed in service during 2019 , with total capacity of up to 550 mbbl/d . the global economy and the energy industry have been deeply impacted by the effects of the coronavirus disease 2019 ( covid-19 ) pandemic and related governmental actions . uncertainty in the oil markets and the negative demand implications of the covid-19 pandemic continue to impact oil supply and demand . altus management continues to monitor natural gas throughput volumes from apache and capacity utilization of the equity method interest pipelines . during the second quarter of 2020 , apache shut in approximately 70 mmcf/d of production in response to low commodity prices , which fell as a result of lower demand and higher uncertainty associated with the covid-19 pandemic . these volumes came back online during the third quarter of 2020 after prices began to recover . story_separator_special_tag also included within this expense is the accretion associated with estimated asset retirement obligations ( aro ) . depreciation and accretion expense would be expected to increase during future periods in-line with additional infrastructure costs incurred ; however , any future asset sales or long-lived asset impairments would decrease expected depreciation expense to commensurate levels . general and administrative general and administrative ( g & a ) expense represents indirect costs and overhead expenditures incurred by the company associated with managing the midstream assets . these expenses primarily comprise fixed fees set forth in the construction , operations and maintenance agreement ( coma ) entered into with apache . refer to note 3 —transactions with affiliates in the notes to consolidated financial statements set forth in part iv of this annual report on form 10-k for further information . taxes other than income taxes other than income are primarily related to ad valorem taxes on the company 's midstream assets . adjusted ebitda the company defines adjusted ebitda as net income ( loss ) including noncontrolling interests before financing costs ( net of capitalized interest ) , interest income , income taxes , depreciation , and accretion and adjusts such items , as applicable , from income from the equity method interest pipelines . altus also excludes ( when applicable ) impairments , unrealized gains or losses on derivative instruments , and other items affecting comparability of results to peers . company management believes adjusted ebitda is useful for evaluating operating performance and comparing results of operations from period-to-period and against peers without regard to financing or capital structure . adjusted ebitda should not be considered as an alternative to , or more meaningful than , net income ( loss ) including noncontrolling interests or any other measure determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states ( gaap ) or as an indicator of the company 's operating performance or liquidity . certain items excluded from adjusted ebitda are significant components in understanding and assessing altus ' financial performance , such as cost of capital and tax structure , as well as the historic costs of depreciable assets , none of which are components of adjusted ebitda . the presentation of adjusted ebitda should not be construed as an inference that the company 's results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items . additionally , the company 's computation of adjusted ebitda may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies . adjusted ebitda is not defined in gaap the gaap measure used by the company that is most directly comparable to adjusted ebitda is net income ( loss ) including noncontrolling interests . adjusted ebitda should not be considered as an alternative to the gaap measure of net income ( loss ) including noncontrolling interests or any other measure of financial performance presented in accordance with gaap . adjusted ebitda has important limitations as an analytical tool because it excludes some , but not all , items that affect net income ( loss ) including noncontrolling interests . adjusted ebitda should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of the company 's results as reported under gaap . the company 's definition of adjusted ebitda may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies in the industry , thereby diminishing its utility . 28 reconciliation of non-gaap financial measure company management compensates for the limitations of adjusted ebitda as an analytical tool by reviewing the comparable gaap measure , understanding the differences between adjusted ebitda as compared to net income ( loss ) including noncontrolling interests , and incorporating this knowledge into its decision-making processes . management believes that investors benefit from having access to the same financial measure that the company uses in evaluating operating results . the following table presents a reconciliation of the gaap financial measure of net income ( loss ) including noncontrolling interests to the non-gaap financial measure of adjusted ebitda . replace_table_token_3_th 29 story_separator_special_tag feature . refer to note

year ended december 31 , 2020 , as compared to the year ended december 31 , 2019 , as a result of a decrease in the average cash and cash equivalents balance maintained by the company throughout the year . income from equity method interests , net as of december 31 , 2020 , the company holds equity interests in four pipelines . income from the equity method interest pipelines was primarily driven by the company 's proportionate share of net income from gcx and shin oak , partially offset by net losses attributable to epic . gcx and shin oak were placed into service during 2019 , and 2020 reflected the first full year of earnings for these pipelines . epic was placed into service in early 2020 and operated at a net loss during 2020. php was in the commissioning phase and flowing

more information . financing costs , net of capitalized interest financing costs incurred , net of capitalized interest , includes increases in interest expense related to higher balances drawn on the company 's credit facility throughout the current year as compared to 2019 ; however , most of the interest expense on the company 's credit facility was eligible to have interest capitalized in all periods presented . 33 provisions for income taxes current income tax benefit for the years ended december 31 , 2020 and 2019 were a benefit of $ 696.0 thousand and $ 15.0 thousand , respectively .

of part i and item 6 of part ii , contains forward-looking statements . forward-looking statements include any statements related to our expectations regarding future performance or market position , including any statements regarding anticipated sales across markets , distribution channels and product categories , access to raw materials and factory capacity , financing and working capital requirements and resources and our exposure to market risk associated with interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates . these forward-looking statements , and others we make from time to time , are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties . many factors may cause actual results to differ materially from those projected in forward-looking statements , including the risks described above in item 1a , risk factors . we do not undertake any duty either to update forward-looking statements after the date they are made or to conform them to actual results or to changes in circumstances or expectations . our business as one of the largest outdoor apparel and footwear companies in the world , we design , source , market and distribute active outdoor apparel , footwear , accessories and equipment under the columbia , mountain hardwear , sorel and montrail brands . our products are sold through a mix of wholesale distribution channels , independent distributors , our own direct-to-consumer channels and licensees . the popularity of outdoor activities , changing design trends and consumer adoption of innovative performance technologies affect consumer desire for our products . therefore , we seek to anticipate and respond to trends and shifts in consumer preferences by adjusting the mix of available product offerings , developing new products with innovative performance features and designs , and creating persuasive and memorable marketing communications to drive consumer awareness and demand . failure to anticipate or respond to consumer needs and preferences in a timely and adequate manner could have a material adverse effect on our sales and profitability . seasonality and variability of business our business is affected by the general seasonal trends common to the outdoor industry and is heavily dependent upon discretionary consumer spending patterns . our products are marketed on a seasonal basis and our product mix is weighted substantially toward the fall season , resulting in sales and profits being highest in the third calendar quarter . the expansion of our own direct-to-consumer operations beginning in 2008 has increased the proportion of sales and profits that we generate in the fourth calendar quarter . in 2009 and 2010 , our profits were earned entirely in the second half of the year , reflecting the dependence upon our sales results in the latter part of the year as well as a higher fixed cost structure of our business . results of operations in any period should not be considered indicative of the results to be expected for any future period , particularly in light of persistent volatility in economic conditions . sales of our products are subject to substantial cyclical fluctuation , the effects of unseasonable weather conditions , and the continued popularity of outdoor activities as part of an active lifestyle in key markets . the current economic environment in key markets , coupled with challenging capacity constraints across the independent manufacturing and transportation segments of our supply chain , reduced the predictability of our business throughout 2010 and into 2011 . 27 business outlook the business climate continues to present us with a great deal of uncertainty , with a number of variables that we rely on for planning purposes moving in opposing directions making it more difficult to predict future results . factors that could significantly affect our 2011 outlook include : unseasonable weather conditions affecting consumer demand and the resulting effect on order cancellations and reorders ; changes in mix and volume of full price sales in contrast with closeout product sales ; manufacturing and or transportation capacity constraints ; the variability of input costs across our supply chain ; costs of expedited transportation ; incremental sales through our expanding direct-to-consumer operations , which are not included in backlog ; changes in consumer spending activity and sales fluctuations in our own retail stores ; and fluctuating currency exchange rates . like other branded consumer product companies , our business is heavily dependent upon discretionary consumer spending patterns . continuing high levels of unemployment in our key markets and restricted credit markets for consumers and retailers continue to pose significant challenges and risks . as a result , a more cautious approach by our wholesale customers may persist , resulting in risk of reduction , delay or cancellation of advance orders prior to shipment . story_separator_special_tag net sales of footwear increased $ 55.6 million , or 26 % , to $ 270.2 million in 2010 from $ 214.6 million in 2009. the increase in footwear net sales by brand

as a percentage of net sales increased to 42.4 % in 2010 from 42.1 % in 2009. gross profit margins expanded primarily due to a higher volume of direct-to-consumer sales at higher gross margins , improved gross margins on close-out product sales and favorable foreign currency hedge rates , largely offset by increased costs to expedite production and delivery of fall 2010 orders to wholesale customers . our gross profit may not be comparable to those of other companies in our industry because some include all of the costs related to their distribution network in cost of sales . we , like others , have chosen to include these expenses as a component of selling , general and administrative expense . selling , general and administrative expense : selling , general and administrative

a expense increased $ 89.4 million , or 20 % , to $ 534.1 million in 2010 from $ 444.7 million in 2009. the sg & a expense increase was primarily due to : increased global personnel costs resulting

item 7 executive overview on july 1 , 2019 , we acquired 100 % of the outstanding equity interest in ranir global holdings , llc ( `` ranir '' ) , a privately-held company . after post-closing adjustments , the total cash consideration paid was $ 747.7 million , net of $ 11.5 million cash acquired . ranir is headquartered in grand rapids , michigan , and is a leading global supplier of private label and branded oral self-care products . this transaction advanced our transformation to a consumer-focused , self-care company and enhanced our position as a global leader in consumer self-care solutions . ranir operations are reported in our csca and csci segments ( refer to item 8. note 3 ) . impact of covid-19 pandemic we have been impacted by the coronavirus ( covid-19 ) global pandemic and the responses by government entities to combat the virus . we currently continue to operate in all our jurisdictions and are complying with the rules and guidelines prescribed in each jurisdiction . we are closely monitoring the impact of covid-19 on all aspects of our business in all our global locations . our first priority has been , and will continue to be , the safety of our employees who continue to come to work and are dedicated to keeping our essential products flowing into the market . we have taken extra precautions at our facilities , to help ensure the health and safety of our employees , that are in line with guidance from global and local health authorities . among other precautions implemented , we have generally restricted access to our production facilities worldwide to essential employees only and permitted a limited number of nonessential employees into other facilities with a strict approval process , implemented a multi-step pre-screening access process before an employee can enter a facility , communicated regularly with employees and provided education and implemented controls related to physical distancing and hygiene measures , implemented remote work arrangements where appropriate , restricted business travel , and prioritized production of essential products for several months following the initial outbreak . to date , these arrangements have not materially affected our ability to maintain our business operations , including the operation of financial reporting systems , internal control over financial reporting , and disclosure controls and procedures . both the outbreak of the disease and the actions to slow its spread have had an adverse impact on our operations by , among other things , increasing absenteeism , affecting the supply of raw materials and third party supplied finished goods , and preventing many of our employees from coming to work . we have responded to such impacts by , among other things , implementing protocols to protect the health of factory workers , adjusting production schedules , and seeking alternate suppliers where available , and so far , most of our facilities have continued to produce at high levels despite these challenges . however , a number of jurisdictions that relaxed such restrictions , or have experienced limited public adherence with suggested safety measures , have experienced new surges in covid-19 cases . many of these jurisdictions continue to contemplate or implement new or renewed restrictions . in addition , as conditions worldwide continue to evolve , there is uncertainty about the timing of widespread availability and acceptance of vaccines . as such , if the pandemic continues or intensifies , it is possible that these or other challenges may begin having a larger impact on our operations . additionally , concerns over the economic impact of covid-19 have caused extreme volatility in financial and other capital markets which has adversely impacted , and may continue to adversely impact our stock price and our ability to access capital markets . the situation surrounding covid-19 remains fluid , and we are actively managing our response and assessing potential impacts to our financial condition , supply chains and other operations , employees , results of operations , consumer demand for our products , and our ability to access capital . the magnitude of any such adverse impact can not currently be determined due to a number of uncertainties surrounding covid-19 ( refer to item 1a . risk factors - operational risks for related risks ) . during the year ended december 31 , 2020 , all of our segments experienced product demand shifts that caused net sales to increase in certain product categories and decrease in other categories . we attribute these demand shifts to consumer and customer behavior surrounding the covid-19 pandemic and the movement and social distancing restrictions put in place to combat spreading of the virus , such as travel bans , country lock-downs , and school closings as well as mask mandates . we also believe that the social distancing measures and mask mandates contributed to the decline in total cough and cold illnesses during the fourth quarter of 2020 , which resulted in a decline of net sales for cough and cold products in our upper respiratory category . we currently expect this impact to continue in the first half of 2021. also , during the year ended december 31 , 2020 , we had incremental operating costs of approximately $ 18.0 million related to covid-19 , primarily due to the precautions implemented to keep our employees safe and properly rewarded during the pandemic as well as increased material costs . we expect that similar costs will continue into calendar year 2021. we also experienced a decrease in our effective tax rate due to additional interest and depreciation deductions provided for in the coronavirus aid , relief and economic security act ( the “ cares 54 perrigo company plc - item 7 executive overview act ” ) enacted on march 27 , 2020 resulting in a reduction of income tax expense by approximately $ 36.6 million during the year ended december 31 , 2020. given our financial strength , we expect to continue to maintain sufficient liquidity as we manage through the pandemic .
","segment financial results year ended december 31 , 2020 vs. december 31 , 2019 replace_table_token_13_th net sales increased $ 7.6 million , or 1 % , due to : $ 3.6 million net sales increase was due primarily to $ 137.6 million from albuterol sales prior to the recall and an increase of $ 27.3 million in other new product sales . these increases were largely offset by normal pricing pressure , $ 35.2 million of discontinued lower margin distribution products , $ 31.2 million for the establishment of the estimated albuterol recall reserve , and lower prescription volumes caused by reductions in doctor visits from the covid-19 pandemic . 67 perrigo company plc - item 7 rx $ 4.0 million increase due to favorable foreign currency translation . operating income decreased $ 180.3 million , or 6,935 % , due to : $ 19.6 million decrease in gross profit due primarily to the net charge of $ 22.5 million from the albuterol recall , partially offset by the increase in net sales as described above . gross profit as a percentage of net sales decreased 230 basis points due primarily to the gross profit factors discussed above and unfavorable product mix ; and $ 160.7 million increase in operating expenses due primarily to : ◦ $ 176.1 million increase in impairment charges due primarily to $ 346.8 million of goodwill impairments in the current year period being partially offset by $ 170.7 million in impairment charges related to goodwill , certain definite-lived intangible assets and ipr & d in the prior year ; partially offset by ◦ $ 11.9 million decrease in r & d expenses due primarily to albuterol pre-commercialization r & d costs expensed in the prior year ; and ◦ $ 4.0 million decrease in selling and administration expenses due primarily to our current project momentum cost savings initiative .

"88 under the quarterly idr provisions of our partnership agreement , our managing general partner is entitled to receive 15 % of the amount we distribute in excess of $ 0.275 per unit story_separator_special_tag general the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the historical financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k. for more detailed information regarding the basis of presentation for the following financial information , please see item 8. financial statements and supplementary data.note 1. organization and presentation and note 2. summary of significant accounting policies. executive overview we are a diversified producer and marketer of coal primarily to major u.s. utilities and industrial users . in 2011 , we produced 30.8 million tons of coal and we sold 31.9 million tons . the coal we produced in 2011 was approximately 8.1 % low-sulfur coal , 19.2 % medium-sulfur coal and 72.7 % high-sulfur coal . we classify low-sulfur coal as coal with a sulfur content of less than 1 % , medium-sulfur coal as coal with a sulfur content between 1 % and 2 % , and high-sulfur coal as coal with a sulfur content of greater than 2 % . we operate ten underground mining complexes , including the new tunnel ridge mine in west virginia , and at december 31 , 2011 , had approximately 911.4 million tons of proven and probable coal reserves in illinois , indiana , kentucky , maryland , pennsylvania and west virginia . approximately 204.9 million tons of those reserves are leased to white oak . for more information on white oak , please read item 8. financial statements and supplementary datanote 10. white oak transactions. we believe we control adequate reserves to implement our currently contemplated mining plans . we are constructing a new mine in southern indiana , operate a coal loading terminal on the ohio river at mt . vernon , indiana and are purchasing and funding development of reserves , constructing surface facilities and making equity investments in white oak 's new mining complex in southern illinois . please see item 1. businessmining operations for further discussion of our mines . 44 as discussed in more detail in item 1a . risk factors ,  our results of operations could be impacted by prices for fuel , steel , explosives and other supplies , unforeseen geologic conditions or mining and processing equipment failures and unexpected maintenance problems , and by the availability or reliability of transportation for coal shipments . additionally , our results of operations could be impacted by our ability to obtain and renew permits necessary for our operations , secure or acquire coal reserves , or find replacement buyers for coal under contracts with comparable terms to existing contracts . moreover , the regulatory environment has grown increasingly stringent in recent years . as outlined in item 1. businessregulation and laws a variety of measures taken by regulatory agencies in the u.s. and abroad in response to the perceived threat from climate change attributed to greenhouse gas emissions could substantially increase compliance costs for us and our customers and reduce demand for coal , which could materially and adversely impact our results of operations . for additional information regarding some of the risks and uncertainties that affect our business and the industry in which we operate , see item 1a . risk factors. our principal expenses related to the production of coal are labor and benefits , equipment , materials and supplies , maintenance , royalties and excise taxes . unlike many of our competitors in the eastern u.s. , we employ a totally union-free workforce . many of the benefits of our union-free workforce are related to higher productivity and are not necessarily reflected in our direct costs . in addition , while we do not pay our customers ' transportation costs , they may be substantial and are often the determining factor in a coal consumer 's contracting decision . our mining operations are located near many of the major eastern utility generating plants and on major coal hauling railroads in the eastern u.s. our river view and tunnel ridge mines and mt . vernon transloading facility are located on the ohio river , and as indicated in item 2. properties , most of our operations have access to barge facilities . our primary business strategy is to create sustainable , capital-efficient growth in available cash to maximize distributions to our unitholders by : expanding our operations by adding and developing mines and coal reserves in existing , adjacent or neighboring properties ; extending the lives of our current mining operations through acquisition and development of coal reserves using our existing infrastructure ; continuing to make productivity improvements to remain a low-cost producer in each region in which we operate ; strengthening our position with existing and future customers by offering a broad range of coal qualities , transportation alternatives and customized services ; and developing strategic relationships to take advantage of opportunities within the coal industry and mlp sector . we have five reportable segments : the illinois basin , central appalachia , northern appalachia , white oak and other and corporate . the first three segments correspond to the three major coal producing regions in the eastern u.s. coal quality , coal seam height , mining and transportation methods and regulatory issues are similar within each of these three segments . the white oak segment includes our activities associated with the white oak longwall mine no . 1 development project in southern illinois . these activities currently encompass an equity investment in white oak , the purchase , leaseback and funding of development of the white oak coal reserves and the construction and operation of surface facilities . story_separator_special_tag our long-term contracts contribute to our stability and profitability by providing greater predictability of sales volumes and sales prices . in 2011 , approximately 95.0 % of our medium- and high-sulfur coal was sold to utility plants with installed pollution control devices . these devices , also known as scrubbers , eliminate substantially all emissions of sulfur dioxide . health care reform on march 23 , 2010 , president obama signed into law the ppaca . additionally , on march 30 , 2010 , president obama signed into law a reconciliation measure , the health care and education reconciliation act of 2010. implementation of the ppaca and the health care and education reconciliation act ( collectively , the health care act ) will result in comprehensive changes to health care in the u.s. implementation of this legislation is planned to occur in phases , with standard plan changes already taking effect and extending through 2018. the health care act continues to have implications on benefit plan eligibility , coverage requirements , and benefit standards and limitations . in the long term , our plan 's health care costs are expected to increase for various reasons due to the health care act , including the potential impact of an excise tax on high cost plans ( beginning in 2018 ) , among other standard requirements . we have chosen not to grandfather our health care plan as allowed under the health care act . this decision allows us to make benefit modifications that encourage participants to use high-value , lower-cost medical-care options such as on-site medical services , generic preferred medications , and urgent-care centers instead of emergency rooms . we anticipate that certain government agencies will provide additional regulations or interpretations concerning the application of the health care act and reporting required thereunder . in addition , various states , and numerous organizations and individual persons , have filed actions in federal court challenging the constitutionality of ppaca with varying results . the u.s. supreme court has agreed to review the suits . until these regulations or interpretations are published , we are unable to reasonably estimate the further impact of such federal mandate requirements on our future health care costs . the health care act also amended previous legislation related to coal workers ' pneumoconiosis , or black lung , providing automatic extension of awarded lifetime benefits to surviving spouses and providing changes to the legal criteria used to assess and award claims . the impact of these changes to our current population of beneficiaries and claimants resulted in an estimated $ 8.3 million increase to our black lung obligation at december 31 , 2010. this increase to our obligation excludes the impact of potential re-filing of closed claims and potential filing rates for employees who terminated more than seven years ago as we do not have sufficient information to determine what , if any , claims will be filed until regulations are issued or claim development patterns are identified through future litigation of claims . the issuance of these regulations , if any , is currently uncertain and may take place over the next several years . we will continue to evaluate the potential impact of the legislation on our self-insured long term disability plan , black lung liabilities , results of operations and internal controls as governmental agencies issue interpretations regarding the meaning and scope of the health care act . however , we believe it is likely that our costs will continue to increase as a result of these provisions , which may have an adverse impact on our results of operations and cash flows . 47 the doddfrank act on july 21 , 2010 , president obama signed into law the doddfrank act . the doddfrank act gives regulators new resolution authority , creates a new council to monitor and address systemic risk , changes the mandate of the federal reserve , imposes significant new regulations on banking organizations , makes significant changes to the rules that affect the process of financing business enterprises and creates a new governmental authority , the bureau of consumer financial protection , to regulate retail financial products and services , among many other provisions . the additional regulations imposed by the doddfrank act on financial institutions may result in increased costs associated with future borrowings and decreased availability of credit . however , we are presently unable to determine the significance of any potential increase in our borrowing costs or potential liquidity constraints , if any . the doddfrank act also requires public mining companies to report certain safety information regarding citations , penalties and pending legal actions as an exhibit included with each periodic report filed with the sec and to file current reports on form 8-k for certain compliance matters . story_separator_special_tag ont size= '' 1 '' > operating expenses in 2010 included $ 1.2 million for the retirement of certain assets resulting from the failure of the vertical hoist conveyor system at our pattiki mine . for more information , please read part ii .

$ 17.1 million in 2010. the increase of $ 37.2 million was primarily attributable to increased coal brokerage activity as well as mettiki 's higher tons and cost per ton of coal purchased , both in 2011. other sales and operating revenues . other sales and operating revenues are principally comprised of mt . vernon transloading revenues , matrix design sales and other outside services and administrative services revenue from affiliates . other sales and operating revenues increased to $ 25.5 million in 2011 from $ 24.9 million in 2010. the increase of $ 0.6 million was primarily attributable to increased matrix design sales , partially offset by lower transloading revenues . general and administrative .
","analysis of historical results of operations 2011 compared with 2010 we reported record net income of arlp of $ 389.4 million in 2011 compared to $ 321.0 million in 2010. this increase of $ 68.4 million was principally due to increased tons sold and improved contract pricing resulting in an average coal sales price of $ 55.95 per ton sold , as compared to $ 51.21 per ton sold in 2010. we sold 31.9 million tons and produced 30.8 million tons in 2011 compared to 30.3 million tons sold and 28.9 million tons produced in 2010. this increase in tons sold and produced primarily reflects increased production from our river view mine and the resumption of full production at our pattiki mine in early 2011 , as well as expanded coal brokerage activity . higher operating expenses during 2011 resulted primarily from increased sales and production volumes , which particularly impacted materials and supplies expenses , sales-related expenses , maintenance costs and labor costs . increased operating expenses also reflect increased incidental production at our tunnel ridge mine and higher outside coal purchases . replace_table_token_8_th coal sales . coal sales increased 15.1 % to $ 1.8 billion in 2011 from $ 1.6 billion in 2010. the increase of $ 234.6 million reflected the benefit of higher average coal sales prices ( contributing $ 151.2 million in coal sales ) and increased tons sold ( contributing $ 83.4 million in additional coal sales ) . average coal sales price increased $ 4.74 per ton sold in 2011 to $ 55.95 per ton compared to $ 51.21 per ton in 2010 , primarily as a result of improved contract pricing across all regions . operating expenses and outside coal purchases . operating expenses and outside coal purchases increased 15.5 % to $ 1.2 billion in 2011 from $ 1.0 billion in 2010 primarily due to record coal sales and production volumes .

the initial cost of the investment in proportion to the story_separator_special_tag management 's discussion and analysis is intended to assist readers in understanding our results of operations and changes in financial position for the past three years . this review should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes beginning on page 91 of this report and the supplemental financial data contained in tables 1 through 22 included with this discussion and analysis . overview - 2013 compared to 2012 we returned to profitability in 2013 after a loss in 2012. earnings for 2012 were significantly impacted by charges associated with a loan disposition and foreclosed property write-down that occurred in the fourth quarter of 2012. replace_table_token_3_th the following is a more detailed discussion of our results for 2013 compared to 2012 : for the year ended december 31 , 2013 , we reported net income available to common shareholder of $ 19.8 million , or $ 0.98 per diluted common share , compared to a net loss of $ 26.2 million , or ( $ 1.54 ) per diluted common share , for the year ended december 31 , 2012. the following significant factors occurred in 2012 that impacted comparability between 2012 and 2013 : · in the fourth quarter of 2012 , we reported the completion of a capital raise totaling $ 33.8 million . a combination of common and preferred stock was issued , including 2,656,294 shares of common stock and 728,706 shares of non-voting preferred stock , each at the same price of $ 10.00 per share . 32 · also in the fourth quarter of 2012 , we identified a $ 68 million pool of non-covered higher-risk loans that were targeted for sale to a third-party investor . based on an offer to purchase these loans that was received in december 2012 , we wrote the loans down by approximately $ 38 million in the fourth quarter of 2012 , which required an incremental provision for loan losses of $ 33.6 million . the loans had a remaining carrying value of approximately $ 30 million and were reclassified as “ loans held for sale. ” of the $ 68 million in loans targeted for sale , approximately $ 38.2 million had been classified as nonaccrual loans , and $ 10.5 million had been classified as accruing troubled-debt-restructurings . the sale of substantially all of these loans was completed on january 23 , 2013 . · in the fourth quarter of 2012 , we recorded write-downs totaling $ 10.6 million on substantially all of our non-covered foreclosed properties in connection with efforts to accelerate the sale of these assets . · in the first quarter of 2012 , we recorded a provision for loan loss on non-covered loans of $ 18.6 million , which was significantly higher than any prior quarterly provision for loan loss for non-covered loans . this higher provision was the result of an internal review of non-covered loans that occurred in the first quarter of 2012 that applied more conservative assumptions to estimate the probable losses associated with some of our nonperforming loan relationships , which we believed could lead to a more timely resolution of the related credits . many of these same loans were included in the loans transferred to the held-for-sale category in the fourth quarter of 2012. we note that our results of operation are significantly affected by the on-going accounting for two fdic-assisted failed bank acquisitions . in the discussion in this document , the term “ covered ” is used to describe assets included as part of fdic loss share agreements , which generally result in the fdic reimbursing the company for 80 % of losses incurred on those assets during the terms of the agreements . the term “ non-covered ” refers to our legacy assets , which are not included in any type of loss share arrangement . for covered loans that deteriorate in terms of repayment expectations , we record immediate allowances through the provision for loan losses . for covered loans that experience favorable changes in credit quality compared to what was expected at the acquisition date , including loans that payoff , we record positive adjustments to interest income over the life of the respective loan – also referred to as loan discount accretion . for covered foreclosed properties that are sold at gains or losses or that are written down to lower values , we record the gains/losses within noninterest income . the adjustments discussed above are recorded within the income statement line items noted without consideration of the fdic loss share agreements . because favorable changes in covered assets result in lower expected fdic claims , and unfavorable changes in covered assets result in higher expected fdic claims , the fdic indemnification asset is adjusted to reflect those expectations . the net increase or decrease in the indemnification asset is reflected within noninterest income . the adjustments noted above can result in volatility within individual income statement line items . because of the fdic loss share agreements and the associated indemnification asset , pretax income resulting from amounts recorded as provisions for loan losses on covered loans , discount accretion , and losses from covered foreclosed properties is generally only impacted by 20 % of these amounts due to the corresponding adjustments made to the indemnification asset . total assets at december 31 , 2013 amounted to $ 3.2 billion , a 1.8 % decrease from a year earlier . total loans at december 31 , 2013 amounted to $ 2.5 billion , a 3.6 % increase from a year earlier , and total deposits amounted to $ 2.8 billion at december 31 , 2013 , a 2.5 % decrease from a year earlier . total loans increased in 2013 , as growth in non-covered loans exceeded the steady decline in covered loans . story_separator_special_tag replace_table_token_4_th the following is a more detailed discussion of our results for 2012 compared to 2011 : for the year ended december 31 , 2012 , we reported a net loss available to common shareholders of $ 26.2 million , or ( $ 1.54 ) per diluted common share , compared to net income of $ 7.5 million , or $ 0.44 per diluted common share , for the year ended december 31 , 2011. our results for 2012 were significantly impacted by a capital raise and an asset disposition initiative ( comprised of a loan sale and foreclosed property write-down ) that both occurred in the fourth quarter of 2012 , as previously discussed . 35 other significant factors that affect the comparability of the full year 2012 and 2011 results are : · in the first quarter of 2012 , we recorded a provision for loan loss on non-covered loans of $ 18.6 million , which was significantly higher than any prior quarterly provision for loan loss for non-covered loans . this higher provision was the result of an internal review of non-covered loans that occurred in the first quarter of 2012 that applied more conservative assumptions to estimate the probable losses associated with some of our nonperforming loan relationships , which we believed could lead to a more timely resolution of the related credits . many of these same loans were included in the loans transferred to the held-for-sale category in the fourth quarter of 2012 . · in the third quarter of 2011 , we recorded $ 2.3 million in accelerated accretion of the discount remaining on preferred stock that was redeemed that quarter . total discount accretion of the preferred stock in 2011 was $ 2.9 million . there was no remaining preferred stock discount after the redemption transaction in september 2011 , and therefore we did not record any discount accretion on preferred stock in 2012 . · in the first quarter of 2011 , we realized a $ 10.2 million bargain purchase gain related to the acquisition of the bank of asheville in asheville , north carolina . total assets at december 31 , 2012 amounted to $ 3.2 billion , a 1.4 % decrease from a year earlier . total loans at december 31 , 2012 amounted to $ 2.4 billion , a 2.2 % decrease from a year earlier , and total deposits amounted to $ 2.8 billion at december 31 , 2012 , a 2.4 % increase from a year earlier . during 2012 , we continued to originate new loans within our non-covered loan portfolio . however , due to the aforementioned loan sale , we wrote-down and transferred a total of $ 68 million from this category in the fourth quarter of 2012. even with the transfer , our non-covered loans increased by $ 25.0 million , or 1.2 % , for the year and amounted to $ 2.1 billion at december 31 , 2012. while our total deposit increase was 2.4 % for the year , there was a significant shift in the mix of our deposits . our level of non-interest bearing checking accounts amounted to $ 413.2 million at december 31 , 2012 , a 23.0 % increase from a year earlier , while interest-bearing checking accounts amounted to $ 519.6 million , an increase of 22.7 % from a year earlier . the overall growth in checking and other transaction accounts allowed us to reduce our reliance on higher cost time deposits and borrowings . time deposits declined by 12 % and borrowings declined by 65 % . net interest income for the year ended december 31 , 2012 amounted to $ 135.2 million , a 2.3 % increase from the $ 132.2 million recorded 2011. the higher net interest income was primarily caused by an increase in 2012 in the amount of discount accretion on loans purchased in failed bank acquisitions . loan discount accretion amounted to $ 16.5 million for 2012 compared to $ 11.6 million in 2011 , an increase of $ 4.9 million . as previously discussed , the impact of changes in discount accretion on pretax income is only 20 % of the gross amount of the change . see “ net interest income ” below for additional information . our net interest margin ( tax-equivalent net interest income divided by average earning assets ) for 2012 was 4.78 % compared to 4.72 % for 2011. the higher margin was primarily a result of a higher amount of discount accretion as noted above , as well as lower overall funding costs . the higher amount of discount accretion was due to increased expectations regarding the collectability of the loans . our cost of funds declined from 0.80 % for 2011 to 0.59 % in 2012 . 36 our total provisions for loan losses amounted to $ 79.7 million compared to $ 41.3 million for 2011. for 2012 , the provision for loan losses on non-covered loans amounted to $ 70.0 million compared to $ 28.5 million for 2011. the higher provision was primarily a result of the loan sale initiative and an elevated provision for loan losses we recorded in the first quarter of 2012 , both of which were described above . we recorded provisions for loan losses for covered loans amounting to $ 9.7 million and $ 12.8 million for the years ended december 31 , 2012 and 2011 , respectively . the lower provision for the year ended 2012 was due to stabilization in our assessment of the losses associated with our nonperforming covered loans . our non-covered nonperforming assets amounted to $ 106.1 million at december 31 , 2012 ( 3.64 % of non-covered total assets ) a decrease of $ 16.2 million from the $ 122.3 million recorded at december 31 , 2011. the decrease was due to the write-downs associated with the loan sale , as well as the foreclosed property write-downs previously discussed .
","analysis of results of operations net interest income , the “ spread ” between earnings on interest-earning assets and the interest paid on interest-bearing liabilities , constitutes the largest source of our earnings . other factors that significantly affect operating results are the provision for loan losses , noninterest income such as service fees and noninterest expenses such as salaries , occupancy expense , equipment expense and other overhead costs , as well as the effects of income taxes . net interest income net interest income on a reported basis amounted to $ 136.5 million in 2013 , $ 135.2 million in 2012 , and $ 132.2 million in 2011. for internal purposes and in the discussion that follows , we evaluate our net interest income on a tax-equivalent basis by adding the tax benefit realized from tax-exempt securities to reported interest income . net interest income on a tax-equivalent basis amounted to $ 138.0 million in 2013 , $ 136.7 million in 2012 , and $ 133.8 million in 2011. management believes that analysis of net interest income on a tax-equivalent basis is useful and appropriate because it allows a comparison of net interest amounts in different periods without taking into account the different mix of taxable versus non-taxable investments that may have existed during those periods . the following is a reconciliation of reported net interest income to tax-equivalent net interest income . replace_table_token_8_th table 2 analyzes net interest income on a tax-equivalent basis . our net interest income on a tax-equivalent basis increased by 1.0 % in 2013 and 2.2 % in 2012. there are two primary factors that cause changes in the amount of net interest income we record - 1 ) our net interest margin ( tax-equivalent net interest income divided by average interest-earning assets ) , and 2 ) changes in our loans and deposits balances .

"the agencies conducted their investigations in 2015 and early 2016. in january 2016 , the u.s. department of commerce made determinations of antidumping and countervailing duties at rates varying by country and producer and , in february 2016 , the international trade commission determined that the domestic industry has been materially injured by these imports . accordingly , the antidumping and countervailing duties will be imposed on imports from these countries . 18 outlook compared with fourth quarter 2015 , we expect first quarter 2016 labor and benefits costs to be higher with annual wage increases and other timing-related expenses , and seasonally colder weather will increase wood and energy costs . our tax rate will also be higher in the first quarter . these items will be partially offset by slightly higher corrugated products shipments and containerboard production , and lower scheduled mill outage costs . finally , lower published prices for domestic linerboard and medium are expected to adversely affect earnings . as a result , we expect first quarter 2016 earnings to be lower than fourth quarter 2015. story_separator_special_tag ( dollars in millions ) : replace_table_token_8_th ( a ) on october 25 , 2013 , we acquired boise inc.

sales increased $ 2,187.3 million , or 59.7 % , to a record $ 5,852.6 million in 2014 , compared with $ 3,665.3 million in 2013 . the increase in 2014 related to a full year of boise operations , compared with only two months and five days in 2013 ( $ 1,962.8 million ) and increased sales in pca 's historical operations ( $ 224.5 ) , which resulted from higher sales volumes and higher sales prices and mix . packaging . sales increased $ 1,108.6 million , or 32.3 % , to $ 4,540.3 million , compared with $ 3,431.7 million in 2013 . a full year of boise operations contributed $ 878.7 million of the increase and the remaining increase related to higher sales volumes ( $ 160.5 million ) and higher sales prices and mix ( $ 69.4 million ) in pca 's historical operations . total corrugated products volume sold in 2014 , including boise , increased 25.5 % over 2013 and shipments per workday increased 25.0 % . the year ended december 31 , 2014 , included 251 workdays , those days not falling on a weekend or holiday , compared with 250 workdays in 2013. excluding boise shipments , corrugated products shipments increased 4.7 % in total , or 4.3 % per workday in 2014 , compared with 2013. the acquisition of crockett packaging in april 2014 , contributed about 1.0 % to the increase in shipments , with the rest of the increase coming from organic growth . we reduced our outside sales of containerboard , both 21 domestic and export , by 46,000 tons compared with last year and we purchased 182,000 tons of containerboard from the outside market in 2014. containerboard mill production in 2014 was 3,452,000 total tons , including 801,000 tons from boise , compared with 2,749,000 total tons in 2013 , which included 141,000 tons from boise . paper . our paper segment sales include the sales for the white paper mills we acquired from boise . sales for 2014 were $ 1,201.4 million . in 2013 , sales during the two months and five days we owned boise were $ 216.9 million . in 2014 , sales volumes of white paper were 1,114,000 tons , compared with 210,000 tons in 2013 , for the period we owned boise . gross profit gross profit increased $ 362.0 million , or 41.7 % , in 2014 , compared with 2013 . in 2014 , gross profit included $ 58.1 million of expense from special items , most of which related to restructuring charges at our deridder , louisiana mill , including incremental depreciation related to changing the estimated useful lives of newsprint-related assets in connection with our exit from the newsprint business in september 2014. in 2013 , gross profit included $ 21.5 million of expense from special items related to the step-up in value of inventory acquired in the boise acquisition . excluding special items , gross profit increased $ 398.6 million . approximately 90 % of the increase was due to a full year of boise operations , including realized synergies , and the remaining increase was from higher gross profit in pca 's historical packaging operations due to higher sales prices , volume , and mix , partially offset by increases in costs for labor , depreciation , freight , wood fiber , and chemical expenses . gross profit as a percentage of net sales decreased to 21.0 % of net sales in 2014 compared with 23.7 % in 2013 due primarily to a full year impact of the white papers business whose products generally have lower margins than the products sold in the packaging business and the deridder restructuring charges described above . selling , general , and administrative expenses selling , general , and administrative expenses increased $ 142.9 million , or 43.8 % , in 2014 compared with 2013 . approximately 90 % of the increase relates to the acquired boise businesses . the remaining increase in our historical pca business is due primarily to a $ 12.0 million increase in salary and fringe benefit expenses and other increases , which were individually insignificant . story_separator_special_tag we ended the year with $ 184.2 million of cash and $ 326.5 million of unused borrowing capacity under the revolving credit facility , net of letters of credit . currently , our primary uses of cash are for operations , capital expenditures , debt service ( including voluntary payments of debt ) , declared common stock dividends and share repurchases . we believe that net cash generated from operating activities , cash on hand , available borrowings under our revolving credit facility and available capital through access to capital markets will be adequate to meet our liquidity and capital requirements , including payments of any declared common stock dividends for the foreseeable future . as our debt or credit facilities become due , we will need to repay , extend or replace such facilities . our ability to do so will be subject to future economic conditions and financial , business , and other factors , many of which are beyond our control . below is a summary table of our cash flows , followed by a discussion of our sources and uses of cash through operating activities , investing activities , and financing activities ( dollars in millions ) : replace_table_token_9_th 23 operating activities 2015 during 2015 , net cash provided by operating activities was $ 762.6 million , compared with $ 736.1 million for 2014 , an increase of $ 26.5 million . cash from operations excluding changes in cash used for operating assets and liabilities decreased $ 0.7 million . the remaining $ 27.2 million increase from changes in cash used for operating assets and liabilities was primarily due to the following : ( a ) no inventory prebuild for our first quarter 2016 planned maintenance outages due to additional capacity added at our reconfigured deridder , louisiana mill and ( b ) a decrease in accounts receivable related to differences in the timing of collections of receivables . these changes were partially offset by ( a ) higher required cash tax payments resulting from less net operating loss utilization and ( b ) a decrease in accrued liabilities due primarily to lower compensation and benefits accruals . cash requirements for operating activities are subject to pca 's operating needs and the timing of collection of receivables and payments of payables and expenses . 2014 during 2014 , net cash provided by operating activities was $ 736.1 million , compared with $ 608.2 million for 2013 , an increase of $ 127.9 million . cash from operations excluding changes in cash used for operating assets and liabilities increased $ 216.2 million due to record earnings in 2014 , which was driven by the acquisition of boise in fourth quarter 2013. cash used for operating assets and liabilities , excluding acquisitions , totaled $ 97.0 million in 2014 , compared with $ 8.7 million in 2013. the higher requirements for operating assets and liabilities , excluding acquisitions , in 2014 were driven primarily by higher containerboard and office papers inventory levels built in advance of four of our five containerboard mills and two of our three white papers mills taking maintenance outages in the first half of 2015 and lower accounts payable levels due to the timing of payments , partially offset by a decrease in federal and state income taxes receivable at december 31 , 2014 , compared with december 31 , 2013 . investing activities 2015 we used $ 298.1 million for investing activities in 2015 , compared with $ 451.1 million in 2014 . in 2015 , we spent $ 314.5 million for capital investments , compared with $ 420.2 million in 2014 . the decrease in capital spending was due primarily to $ 104.2 million invested in 2014 for the the conversion of the no . 3 newsprint machine at our deridder , louisiana mill to produce containerboard . we received $ 23.0 million of cash proceeds for the sale of our hexacomb corrugated manufacturing operations in mexico and europe during 2015. in 2014 , we paid $ 20.5 million to acquire the assets of crockett packaging , a corrugated products manufacturer . the details of capital expenditures for property and equipment , excluding acquisitions , by segment for the years ended december 31 , 2015 , 2014 , and 2013 , are included in the table below ( dollars in millions ) . replace_table_token_10_th we expect capital investments in 2016 to be between $ 250.0 million and $ 265.0 million , including capital required for boiler mact spending , but excluding any acquisitions . these expenditures could increase or decrease as a result of a number of factors , including our financial results , future economic conditions , and our regulatory compliance requirements . we currently estimate capital expenditures to comply with boiler mact regulations ( as discussed below under `` environmental matters '' ) in 2016 of up to $ 3.0 million and we expect other environmental capital expenditures of about $ 5.0 million in 2016. our estimated environmental expenditures could vary significantly depending upon the enactment of new environmental laws and regulations , including those related to greenhouse gas emissions and industrial boilers . for additional information , see `` environmental matters '' in this management 's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations . 24 at december 31 , 2015 , pca had commitments for capital expenditures of $ 83.7 million . pca believes that cash-on-hand combined with cash flow from operations will be sufficient to fund these commitments . 2014 we used $ 451.1 million for investing activities in 2014 , compared with $ 1,411.4 million in 2013 . in 2014 , we spent $ 420.2 million for capital investments , compared with $ 234.4 million in 2013 . the increase in capital spending was due primarily to having a full year of boise capital investments , including $ 104.2 million for the the conversion of the no . 3 newsprint machine at our deridder

"our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors including the risks we discuss in item 1a , “ risk factors , ” and elsewhere herein . general our operating subsidiaries invest in , license and enforce patented technologies . our operating subsidiaries partner with inventors and patent owners , applying our legal and technology expertise to patent assets to unlock the financial value in their patented inventions . we are an intermediary in the patent marketplace , bridging the gap between invention and application , facilitating efficiency and delivering monetary rewards to patent owners . our operating subsidiaries generate revenues and related cash flows from the granting of patent rights for the use of patented technologies that our operating subsidiaries control or own . our operating subsidiaries assist patent owners with the prosecution and development of their patent portfolios , the protection of their patented inventions from unauthorized use , the generation of licensing revenue from users of their patented technologies and , where necessary , with the enforcement against unauthorized users of their patented technologies through the filing of patent infringement litigation . we are a leader in licensing patented technologies and have established a proven track record of licensing success with over 1,430 license agreements executed to date , across 181 of our patent portfolio licensing and enforcement programs . currently , on a consolidated basis , our operating subsidiaries own or control the rights to multiple patent portfolios , which include u.s. patents and certain foreign counterparts , covering technologies used in a wide variety of industries . to date , we have generated gross licensing revenue of approximately $ 1.1 billion , and have returned more than $ 665 million to our patent partners . the patent portfolio investment , development , licensing and enforcement business conducted by our operating subsidiaries is described more fully in item 1 . “ business , ” of this annual report . executive overview during the periods presented , we continued our business of empowering patent owners and rewarding invention by providing a path to patent monetization for the people and companies who have contributed valuable patented inventions to an industry , but who require a professional , experienced independent third-party licensing partner to get rewarded for those inventions . these people and companies are our customers , and in many cases , components of the patent disenfranchised . in so doing , we have placed ourselves at the forefront of an emerging secondary market in patent assets under which holders of high quality patents , including the patent disenfranchised , may be rewarded for the use of their patented inventions by others , even if they do not have the capital and expertise to engage in lengthy , costly and risky patent litigation . our operating activities for the periods presented were principally focused on the continued investment in and development of our patent licensing and enforcement business , including the continued pursuit of our ongoing patent licensing and enforcement programs and the commencement of new patent licensing and enforcement programs . in addition , we continued our focus on business development , including the investment in several additional high quality patent portfolios by certain of our operating subsidiaries and the continued pursuit of additional opportunities to partner with patent owners and invest in patent portfolios , and continue our industry leading patent licensing and enforcement activities . we have strategically chosen to shift the focus of our operating business to increasingly serve a smaller number of customers each having higher quality patent portfolios . high quality patent portfolios are typically associated with higher numbers of varied defensible claims , higher revenue potential , originating from high-pedigreed patent owners and or possessing a relatively large number of prospective licensees . in this regard , commencing in the later portion of 2013 and early 2014 , we have continued the shift in our focus at our point of patent intake , from quantity to quality . as we have continued to shift our focus as described above , we continue to see a growing need for our services , which we believe will maintain the strength of our high quality patent portfolio intake pipeline . we continue to identify and explore opportunities for partnering with companies in the technology , energy , medical technology and other sectors for the licensing and enforcement of their high quality patented technologies , and are also 25 expanding our activity in international markets , both of which we expect will expand and diversify our future revenue generating opportunities . operating activities during the periods presented included the following : replace_table_token_5_th we measure and assess the performance and growth of the patent licensing and enforcement businesses conducted by our operating subsidiaries based on consolidated revenues ( including other operating income ) recognized across all of our patent licensing and enforcement programs on a trailing twelve-month basis . trailing twelve-month revenues during the periods presented were as follows ( in thousands , except percentage change values ) : replace_table_token_6_th our revenues historically have fluctuated period to period , and can vary significantly , based on a number of factors including the following : the dollar amount of agreements executed each period , which can be driven by the nature and characteristics of the technology or technologies being licensed and the magnitude of infringement associated with a specific licensee ; the specific terms and conditions of agreements executed each period including the nature and characteristics of rights granted , and the periods of infringement or term of use contemplated by the respective payments ; fluctuations in the total number of agreements executed each period ; the number of , timing , results and uncertainties associated with patent licensing negotiations , mediations , patent infringement actions , trial dates and other enforcement proceedings relating to our patent licensing and enforcement programs ; the relative maturity of licensing programs during the applicable periods ; other external factors , including the periodic status or results of ongoing negotiations , the status or story_separator_special_tag costs in connection with the enhancement of our business development , licensing and engineering teams , an increase in other non-recurring personnel severance costs including the impact of non-recurring cash and non-cash charges associated with paul ryan 's retirement severance package , approved by the board of directors , and a net increase in corporate legal , facilities , general and administrative costs , partially offset by a decrease in variable performance-based compensation costs . ◦ operating expenses for fiscal year 2013 included a one-time , non-recurring charge related to the resolution of a dispute concerning legal fees associated with a prior matter totaling $ 3.5 million . we recorded a pre-tax net loss and a tax benefit for fiscal year 2013 , compared to pre-tax net income and tax expense for fiscal year 2012 , as shown above . our effective tax rate was 27 % for fiscal years 2013 and 2012 , respectively . the fiscal year 2013 effective tax benefit rate was lower than the u.s. federal statutory rate primarily due to an increase in the valuation allowance related to foreign tax credits generated in 2013 and certain permanent nondeductible items . the fiscal year 2012 effective tax rate was lower than the u.s. federal statutory rate primarily due to $ 10.7 million of tax benefits recognized resulting from the release of valuation allowance on the majority of our net deferred tax assets in the first quarter of 2012 , as discussed below . revenues in

"our nominating and governance committee has discretion to decide which individuals story_separator_special_tag the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report . this discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties . our actual results could differ materially from those discussed below . factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include , but are not limited to , those identified below and those discussed in “ risk factors ” included elsewhere in this annual report . as used in this report , unless the context suggests otherwise , `` we , `` `` us , `` our `` or `` the company `` refer to vital therapies , inc. and its subsidiaries . overview we are a clinical-stage biotechnology company focusing on the discovery , development and commercialization of cell-based therapies capable of transforming the management of life-threatening conditions . our initial product candidate , the elad® system , or elad , is a human-cell-based , bio-artificial liver which is being developed to improve rates of survival among patients with acute forms of liver failure . we believe that the elad system may improve rates of overall survival and transform the management of acute forms of liver failure . therapy with elad consists of a single , up to five-day treatment session , during which a patient 's blood plasma is passed continuously through four cartridges containing approximately one pound of vtl c3a cells . we believe these cells , which have been shown to retain a large number of the liver 's synthetic and metabolic functions , may infuse the patient 's plasma with beneficial proteins , including growth factors , cell survival proteins , and anti-inflammatory proteins , and may also remove certain harmful substances . this may better allow the patient 's own liver to recover and regenerate , thereby potentially improving patient survival . the elad system has been granted orphan drug designation by the u.s. food and drug administration , or fda , and the european commission , for the treatment of patients with acute liver failure , including alcoholic hepatitis . this designation provides tax credits for qualified clinical testing , seven years of market exclusivity in the u.s. and ten years of market exclusivity in europe for the first orphan drug approved for a given indication . however , orphan designation does not alter the standard regulatory requirements or the process for obtaining marketing approval . in may 2016 , we commenced our phase 3 vtl-308 clinical study . this is a randomized , open label , multicenter , controlled study comparing the efficacy and safety of the elad system plus standard-of-care to standard-of-care alone in adults , under the age of 50 and without secondary organ failure , with liver failure from severe alcoholic hepatitis , or sah . vtl-308 is designed to enroll at least 150 subjects , and the study 's primary endpoint is overall survival after the last subject to be enrolled has been followed for at least ninety days . as of march 12 , 2018 , 147 subjects have been enrolled in the vtl-308 study , and we expect to announce topline data in the third quarter of 2018. if the data is positive , these results are expected to form the basis for a marketing application to the fda and other global health regulatory authorities for the approval of the elad system for the treatment of sah . results from a prior phase 3 study , vti-208 , informed the design of the vtl-308 study and guided its focus on subjects under the age of 50 without secondary organ failure . the vti-208 study enrolled 203 subjects between 2013 and january 2015 with alcohol-induced liver decompensation , most of whom were experiencing liver failure as a result of sah . in august 2015 , we learned that an analysis of overall survival was not statistically different between treated and control groups . although vti-208 failed to reach either its primary or secondary endpoints , pre-specified and post-hoc analyses identified criteria for a group of subjects in which favorable survival trends were observed . while the vtl-308 phase 3 clinical trial has been designed to show statistical significance based on these pre-specified and post-hoc analyses of the vti-208 trial , there can be no assurance that the data from the trial or that a single trial will be sufficient to support a marketing application in any country . during 2014 , we also initiated enrollment in vti-210 , a second phase 3 clinical trial for subjects with sah , and a phase 2 clinical trial , vti-212 , for subjects with post-surgical liver failure and fulminant hepatic failure . the vti-210 trial was suggested by the european regulatory authority and was intended to include subjects who had failed conventional therapy and were therefore a sicker population than the vti-208 subjects . considering the results of the vti-208 clinical trial and in an effort to focus our personnel and financial resources , we discontinued the vti-210 and vti-212 clinical trials , postponed most activities associated with the preparation for submitting a marketing application to the fda , and reduced our workforce in late 2015. we have incurred net losses since inception of $ 296.0 million through december 31 , 2017 . we anticipate that we will continue to incur losses for at least the next several years . due to the uncertainties involved with biological product development and the clinical trial process , we can not predict the timing or accuracy of future expenses , when product approval for the elad system might occur , if ever , or when profitability may be achieved or sustained . 63 financial operations overview research and development expenses research and development expenses relate to the development of the elad system and are expensed as incurred . story_separator_special_tag stock-based compensation we measure and recognize compensation expense for all stock-based compensation for employees and directors based on the estimated fair value at the date of grant , and to consultants based on the ongoing estimated fair value . currently , our stock-based awards consist only of stock options and restricted stock ; however , future grants under our equity compensation plan may also consist of shares of restricted stock units , stock appreciation rights , performance awards and performance units . we estimate the fair value of stock options using the black-scholes-merton , or bsm , option pricing model , which requires the use of estimates . we recognize stock-based compensation cost for employees and directors for ratably vesting stock options on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period of the award . for performance-based stock options to employees and directors , we record stock-based compensation expense only when the performance-based milestone is deemed probable of achievement . we utilize both quantitative and qualitative criteria to judge whether milestones are probable of achievement . the fair value of options granted to consultants is estimated using the bsm option pricing model and is re-measured at each reporting date with changes in fair value prior to vesting recognized as expense in the consolidated statements of operations across the applicable vesting period . for performance-based stock options to consultants , we record stock-based compensation expense only when the performance-based milestones are achieved unless there is a performance commitment . effective in the first quarter of 2017 , we began recognizing forfeitures as they occur . in 2016 and earlier periods , stock-based compensation expense was recognized only for those awards that were ultimately expected to vest . through 2016 , we estimated forfeitures based on an analysis of our historical employee turnover . we revised the forfeiture estimate in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differed from those estimates . changes in estimated forfeitures , which were not material , impacted compensation cost in the period in which the change in estimate occurred . the bsm option pricing model requires the input of highly-subjective assumptions , including the risk-free interest rate , the expected dividend yield of our common stock , the expected volatility of the price of our common stock , and the expected term of the option . these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management 's judgment . if factors change and different assumptions are used , our stock-based compensation expense could be materially different in the future . 65 income taxes we account for income taxes under the asset and liability method , which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the condensed consolidated financial statements . under this method , deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined on the basis of the differences between the financial statements and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse . the effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date . we recognize net deferred tax assets to the extent we believe these assets are more likely than not to be realized . in making such a determination , management considers all available positive and negative evidence , including future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences , projected future taxable income , tax-planning strategies , and results of recent operations . if management determines that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of their net recorded amount , management would make an adjustment to the deferred tax asset valuation allowance , which would reduce the provision for income taxes . as of december 31 , 2017 and 2016 , we maintained a full valuation allowance against our entire balance of deferred tax assets . we record uncertain tax positions on the basis of a two-step process whereby ( 1 ) management determines whether it is more likely than not that the tax positions will be sustained on the basis of the technical merits of the position and ( 2 ) for those tax positions that meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold , management recognizes the largest amount of tax benefit that is more than 50 percent likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement with the related tax authority . we recognize interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits , if any , within income tax expense , and any accrued interest and penalties are included within the related tax liability line . on december 22 , 2017 , h.r . 1/public law no . 115-97 known as the tax cuts and jobs act , or the tax act , was signed into law . the effects of this new federal legislation are recognized upon enactment , which is the date a bill is signed into law . the tax act includes numerous changes in existing tax law ; however , the most significant provisions affecting the company are a permanent reduction in the federal corporate income tax rate from 35 % to 21 % , annual limitations on the utilization of net operating losses and tax credits , the halving of the orphan drug credit , limitations on the deductibility of compensation paid to covered employees and the capitalization and amortization of research and development costs . story_separator_special_tag decisions with respect to building commercial operations , and any unforeseen cash needs which may deplete current cash and cash equivalents sooner than planned . furthermore , our operating plans may change , and we may need additional funds earlier to meet operational needs and capital requirements for product development ,

"our portfolio includes certain credit sensitive assets and investments sourced from distressed markets in recent years that create the potential for capital gains , as well as more traditional types of mortgage-related investments that generate interest income . our investment portfolio includes residential mortgage loans , including second mortgages and loans sourced from distressed markets , multi-family cmbs , mezzanine loans to and preferred equity investments in owners of multi-family properties , equity and debt securities issued by entities that invest in residential and commercial real estate and commercial real estate-related debt investments and agency rmbs . subject to maintaining our qualification as a reit , we also may opportunistically acquire and manage various other types of mortgage-related and financial assets that we believe will compensate us appropriately for the risks associated with them , including , without limitation , non-agency rmbs ( which may include ios and pos ) , collateralized mortgage obligations and securities issued by newly originated residential securitizations , including credit sensitive securities from these securitizations . we seek to achieve a balanced and diverse funding mix to finance our assets and operations . we currently rely primarily on a combination of short-term borrowings , such as repurchase agreements with terms typically of 30 days , longer term repurchase agreement borrowing with terms between one year and 18 months and longer term structured financings , such as securitizations , with terms longer than one year . we internally manage a certain portion of our portfolio , including agency arms , fixed-rate agency rmbs , non-agency rmbs , clos , residential securitized loans and second mortgage

0.62 per share . we declared aggregate 2015 dividends of $ 1.02 per common share . we issued and sold 4,116,115 shares of common stock under our at-the-market offering programs , resulting in net proceeds to us of $ 31.9 million . we closed on an underwritten public offering of 3,600,000 shares of our 7.875 % series c preferred stock . the issue and sale of the series c preferred stock resulted in total net proceeds to us of $ 86.9 million , after deductions of underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses . we completed the sale of a first loss tranche po security issued by a single freddie mac-sponsored securitization , realizing an aggregate gain of approximately $ 1.5 million . we completed the sale of certain clo securities , realizing a gain of approximately $ 3.2 million . we sold residential mortgage loans , including distressed residential mortgage loans , with a carrying value of approximately $ 146.1 million for aggregate proceeds of

residential mortgage loans during the fourth quarter of 2015 , we closed on the acquisition of two pools of distressed residential mortgage loans for an aggregate purchase price , including accrued interest , of approximately $ 58.4 million . the pools are comprised of re-performing modified first lien mortgage loans that had an aggregate unpaid principal balance of approximately $ 70.4 million at the time of acquisition . completion of financing transactions on november 25 , 2015 , we entered into a master repurchase agreement with deutsche bank ag , cayman islands branch that provides for borrowings in an aggregate principal amount of up to $ 100 million that may be used to fund the future purchase of residential mortgage loans , which loans will serve as collateral for borrowing thereunder . this master repurchase agreement has a term that will expire on may 25 , 2017. the outstanding balance on this master repurchase agreement will bear interest at one-month libor plus 4.0 % and expires on may 25 , 2017. there was no outstanding balance on this master repurchase agreement as of december 31 , 2015 . on december 14 , 2015 , we amended a master repurchase agreement with

was paid on january 25 , 2016 to our common stockholders of record as of december 28 , 2015 . story_separator_special_tag we anticipate further uncertainty as the recent economic data suggests a slowing u.s. economy which may cause the federal reserve to leave rates lower for an extended period . greater uncertainty frequently leads to wider asset spreads or lower prices and higher hedging costs . single-family homes and residential mortgage market . the residential real estate market showed signs of growth during 2015 after decelerating throughout much of 2014. data released by s & p indices for its s & p/case-shiller home price indices for november 2015 showed that , on average , home prices increased 5.8 % for the 20-city composite over november 2014. in addition , according to data provided by the u.s. department of commerce , privately-owned housing starts for single family homes averaged a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 768,000 during the fourth quarter of 2015 , which was 6.1 % above the december 2014 rate of 724,000. we expect the single-family residential real estate market to continue to improve modestly in the near term . we expect that improving single family housing fundamentals will have a positive impact on the overall credit profile of our existing portfolio of distressed residential loans . 48 multi-family housing . apartments and other residential rental properties remain one of the better performing segments of the commercial real estate market . according to data provided by the u.s. department of commerce , starts on multi-family homes containing five units or more averaged a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 365,000 during the fourth quarter of 2015 and 409,917 for the full year 2015 , as compared to 370,333 for the full year 2014. moreover , even with the recent growth in supply , vacancy trends in the multi-family sector appear to remain stable . according to the third quarter of 2015 multifamily vacancy index ( “ mvi ” ) , which is produced by the national association of home builders and surveys the multifamily housing industry 's perception of vacancies , the mvi was at 39 for the third quarter of 2015 , equal to the level reported for the fourth quarter of 2014. strength in the multi-family housing sector has contributed to valuation improvements for multi-family properties and , in turn , many of the multi-family cmbs that we own . we expect the multi-family sector to continue to be a strong performer in the near term given the current favorable conditions for multi-family housing in the u.s ; however , widening credit spreads in the second half of 2015 has caused valuations in this space to pull back from recent highs . credit spreads . during the first six months of 2015 , we saw continued tightening of credit spreads , which had a positive impact on the value of many of our credit sensitive assets while also resulting in a more challenging current return environment for new investment in many of these asset classes . however , during the second half of 2015 and into the beginning of 2016 , credit spreads on many of the credit sensitive assets in which we invest widened , which has negatively impacted the valuation of certain of these assets , particularly our multi-family cmbs investments . in the event credit spreads continue to widen , these assets may experience a further decline in valuation . financing markets . during 2015 , the bond market experienced a significant amount of volatility with the closing yield of the ten-year u.s. treasury note trading between 1.68 % and 2.50 % , settling at 2.27 % at december 31 , 2015. although stabilizing somewhat at the end of 2015 , the bond has market continued to experience significant fluctuations , largely as a result of market reaction to uncertain monetary policy and conditions in the global economy . developments at fannie mae and freddie mac . payments on the agency arms and fixed-rate agency rmbs in which we invest are guaranteed by fannie mae and freddie mac . in addition , although not guaranteed by freddie mac , all of our multi-family cmbs has been issued by securitization vehicles

conservatorship as the u.s. government continues to evaluate the future of these entities and what role the u.s. government should continue to play in the housing markets in the future . since being placed under federal conservatorship , there have been a number of proposals introduced , both from industry groups and by the u.s. congress , relating to changing the role of the u.s. government in the mortgage market and reforming or eliminating fannie mae and freddie mac . it remains unclear how the u.s. congress will move forward on such reform at this time and what impact , if any , this reform will have on mortgage reits . see “ item 1a . risk factors-risks related to our business and our company-changes in laws and regulations affecting the relationship between fannie mae and

charged on these delinquent balances as of december 31 , 2019 . see note 2. summary of significant accounting policies-accounts receivable to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report . prepa is currently subject to bankruptcy proceedings , which were filed in july 2017 and are currently pending in the u.s. district court for the district of puerto rico . as a result , prepa 's ability to meet its payment obligations under the contracts is largely dependent upon funding from the federal emergency management agency or other sources . on september 30 , 2019 ,

solution , the bloom energy server , is a stationary power generation platform built for the digital age and capable of delivering highly reliable , uninterrupted , 24x7 constant power that is also clean and sustainable . the bloom energy server converts standard low-pressure natural gas , biogas or hydrogen into electricity through an electrochemical process without combustion , resulting in very high conversion efficiencies and lower harmful emissions than conventional fossil fuel generation . a typical configuration produces 250 kilowatts of power in a footprint roughly equivalent to that of half of a standard thirty-foot shipping container , or approximately 125 times more space-efficient than solar power generation . 250 kilowatts of power is roughly equivalent to the constant power requirement of a typical big box retail store . any number of our energy server systems can be clustered together in various configurations to form solutions from hundreds of kilowatts to many tens of megawatts . we currently primarily target commercial and industrial customers . we market and sell our energy servers primarily through our direct sales organization in the united states , and also have direct and indirect sales channels internationally . recognizing that deploying our solutions requires a material financial commitment , we have developed a number of financing options to support sales of our energy servers to customers who lack 45 the financial capability to purchase our energy servers directly , who prefer to finance the acquisition using third party financing or who prefer to contract for our services on a pay-as-you-go model . our typical target commercial or industrial customer has historically been either an investment-grade entity or a customer with investment-grade attributes such as size , assets and revenue , liquidity , geographically diverse operations and general financial stability . we have recently expanded our product and financing options to the below-investment-grade customers and have also expanded internationally to target customers with deployments on a wholesale grid . given that our customers are typically large institutions with multi-level decision making processes , we generally experience a lengthy sales process . purchase and lease options initially , we only offered our energy servers on a direct purchase basis , in which the customer purchases the product directly from us . in order to expand our offerings to customers who lack the financial capability to purchase our energy servers directly ( including customers who are unable to monetize the tax credits available to purchasers of our energy servers ) and or who prefer to lease the product or contract for our services on a pay-as-you-go model , we subsequently developed the traditional lease ( `` traditional lease '' ) , managed services , and power purchase agreement programs ( `` ppa programs '' ) . our capacity to offer our energy servers through any of these financed arrangements depends in large part on the ability of the financing party or parties involved to monetize the related investment tax credits , accelerated tax depreciation and other incentives . interest rate fluctuations may also impact the attractiveness of any financing offerings for our customers , and currency exchange fluctuations may also impact the attractiveness of international offerings . the traditional lease , managed services and ppa program options are limited by the creditworthiness of the customer . additionally , the managed services and traditional lease options , as with all leases , are also limited by the customer 's willingness to commit to making fixed payments regardless of the performance of the energy servers or our performance of our obligations under the customer agreement . in each of our purchase options , we typically perform the functions of a project developer , including identifying end customers and financiers , leading the negotiations of the customer agreements and financing agreements , securing all necessary permitting and interconnections approvals , and overseeing the design and construction of the project up to and including commissioning the energy servers . under each purchase option , we provide warranties and performance guaranties for the energy servers ' efficiency and output . we refer to a “ warranty ” as a commitment where the failure of the energy servers to satisfy the stated performance level obligates us to repair or replace the energy servers as necessary to improve performance . if we fail to complete such repair or replacement , or if repair or replacement is impossible , we may be obligated to repurchase the energy servers from the customer or financier . we refer to a “ guaranty ” as a commitment where the failure of the energy servers to satisfy the stated performance level obligates us to make a payment to compensate the beneficiary of such guaranty for the resulting increased cost or diminution in benefits resulting from such failure . our obligation to make payments under the guaranty is always contractually capped and represents a contingency linked to our services obligation with no economic incentive for us to default and force an exercise of the payment obligation . under direct purchase and traditional lease , the warranties and guaranties are typically included in the price of our energy server for the first year . the warranties and guaranties may be renewed annually at the customer 's option , as an operations and maintenance services agreement , at predetermined prices for a period of up to 30 years . story_separator_special_tag once a financier is identified and the energy server 's installation is complete , we sell the energy server contemplated by the managed services agreement directly to a financier and the financier , as lessor , leases it back to us , as lessee , pursuant to a master lease in a sale-leaseback transaction . the proceeds from the sale are recorded as a financing obligation within the consolidated balance sheets . any ongoing operations and maintenance service payments are scheduled in the managed services agreement in the form of the performance-based payment described above . the financier typically pays the financing proceeds for the energy server contemplated by the managed services agreement on or shortly after acceptance . the fixed capacity payments made by the customer under the managed services agreement are recognized as electricity revenue when billed and applied toward our obligation to pay the financing obligation under the master lease . our managed services financings have historically shifted customer credit risk to the financier , as lessor , by providing in the master lease agreement that we have no liability for payment of rent except in certain enumerated circumstances , including in the event we are in breach of the managed services agreement between us and the customer . the duration of the master lease in a managed services financing is typically 10 years . the term of the master lease is typically the same as the term of the related managed services agreement , but in some cases the term of the master lease is shorter than that of the managed services agreement . our managed services deployments typically provide only for warranties of both the efficiency and output of the energy server ( s ) , all of which are written in favor of the customer and contained in the operations and maintenance services agreement . these warranties may be measured on a monthly , annual , cumulative or other basis . managed services projects typically do not include guaranties above the warranty commitments , but in projects where the customer agreement includes a service payment for our operations and maintenance , that payment is typically proportionate to the output generated by the energy server ( s ) and our pricing assumes service revenues at the 95 % output level . this means that our service revenues may be lower than expected if output is less than 95 % and higher if output exceeds 95 % . as of december 31 , 2019 , we had 48 incurred no liabilities due to failure to repair or replace our energy servers pursuant to these warranties and the fleet of our energy servers deployed pursuant to the managed services program was performing at a lifetime average output of approximately 88 % . power purchase agreement programs * under the third party ppa arrangements , there is no link with an investment company , as we do not have an equity investment in these arrangements . in each power purchase agreement , we sell our energy servers to an operating company which sells the electricity generated by the energy servers to the ultimate end customers pursuant to a power purchase agreement , energy services agreement , or similar contract . because the end customer 's payment is stated on a dollar-per-kilowatt-hour ( `` $ /kwh '' ) basis , we refer to these agreements as power purchase agreements ( `` ppas '' ) . currently , our offerings for ppa programs primarily include our third-party ppa programs pursuant to which we recognize revenue on acceptance . through 2017 , as part of our ppa programs , we had also offered the bloom electrons program which included an equity investment by us in the operating company and in which we recognized revenue as the electricity was produced . for further discussion on our bloom electrons programs , see note 13 of our notes to consolidated financial statements . in our power purchase agreement program , we enter into an energy server sales , operations and maintenance agreement ( `` epc and o & m agreement '' ) with the operating company that will own the energy servers . the operating company then enters into the ppa with the end customer which purchases electricity generated by the energy servers . the operating company receives all cash flows generated under the ppa ( s ) , in addition to all investment tax credits , all accelerated tax depreciation benefits , and any other cash flows generated by the operation of the energy servers not allocated to the end customer under the ppa . the sales of our energy servers to the operating company in connection with the various power purchase agreement programs have many of the same terms and conditions as a direct sale . payment of the purchase price is generally broken down into multiple installments , which may include payments prior to shipment , upon shipment or delivery of the energy server , and upon acceptance of the energy server . acceptance typically occurs when the energy server is installed and running at full power as defined in the applicable epc and o & m agreement . a one-year service warranty is provided with the initial sale . after the expiration of the initial standard one-year warranty , the operating company has the option to extend our operations and maintenance services under the epc and o & m agreement on an annual basis at a price determined at the time of purchase of our energy server , which may be renewed annually for each energy server for up to 30 years . after the 49 standard one-year warranty period , the operating company has almost always exercised the option to renew our operations and maintenance obligations under the epc and o & m agreement . we typically provide output warranties and output guaranties to the operating company pursuant to the applicable epc and o & m agreement with the operating company .

( the `` company '' ) , a delaware corporation , operates as a multi-bank holding company for brookline bank and its subsidiaries ; bank rhode island ( `` bankri '' ) and its subsidiaries ; first ipswich bank ( `` first ipswich '' ) and its subsidiaries ; and brookline securities corp. as a commercially-focused financial institution with 49 full-service banking offices throughout greater boston , the north shore of massachusetts and rhode island , the company , through brookline bank , bankri and first ipswich ( the “ banks ” ) , offers a wide range of commercial , business and retail banking services , including a full complement of cash management products , on-line and mobile banking services , consumer and residential loans and investment services , designed to meet the financial needs of small- to mid-sized businesses and individuals throughout central new england . specialty lending activities include equipment financing primarily in the new york and new jersey metropolitan area . the company focuses its business efforts on profitably growing its commercial lending businesses , both organically and through acquisitions . the company 's customer focus , multi-bank structure , and risk management are integral to its organic growth strategy and serve to differentiate the company from its competitors . as full-service financial institutions , the banks and their subsidiaries focus on the continued acquisition of well-qualified customers , the deepening of long-term banking relationships through a full complement of products and excellent customer service , and strong risk management . the company manages the banks under uniform strategic objectives , with one set of uniform policies consistently applied by one executive management team . within this environment , the company believes that the ability to make customer decisions locally enhances management 's motivation , service levels and , as a consequence , the company 's financial results . as such , while most back-office functions are consolidated at the holding company level , branding and decision-making , including credit decisions and pricing , remain largely local in order to better meet the needs of bank customers and further motivate the banks ' commercial , business and retail bankers . the competition for loans and leases and deposits remains intense . while there are signs that the economy has improved in 2015 , the company expects the operating environment in 2016 to remain challenging . the volume of loan and lease originations and loan and lease losses will depend , to a large extent , on how the economy performs . loan and lease growth and deposit growth are also greatly influenced by the rate-setting actions of the board of governors of the federal reserve system ( “ frb ” ) . the low interest rate environment has had and may continue to have a negative impact on the company 's yields and net interest margin . conversely , rising rates in the future could cause changes in the mix and volume of the company 's deposits and make it more difficult for certain borrowers to be eligible for new loans or leases or to service their existing debt . the future operating results of the company will depend on its ability to maintain net interest margin , while minimizing exposure to credit risk , along with increasing sources of non-interest income , while controlling the growth of non-interest or operating expenses . the company and the banks are supervised , examined and regulated by the frb . as a massachusetts-chartered savings bank and trust company , respectively , brookline bank and first ipswich are also subject to regulation under the laws of the commonwealth of massachusetts and the jurisdiction of the massachusetts division of banks . as a rhode island-chartered financial institution , bankri is also subject to regulation under the laws of the state of rhode island and the jurisdiction of the banking division of the rhode island department of business regulation . the federal deposit insurance corporation ( `` fdic '' ) continues to insure each of the banks ' deposits up to $ 250,000 per depositor . additionally , as a massachusetts-chartered savings bank , brookline bank is also insured by the depositors insurance fund ( “ dif ” ) , a private industry-sponsored company . the dif insures savings bank deposits in excess of the fdic insurance limits . as such , brookline bank offers 100 % insurance on all deposits as a result of a combination of insurance from the fdic and the dif . the company 's common stock is traded on the nasdaq global select marketsm under the symbol “ brkl. ” executive overview growth total assets of $ 6.0 billion as of december 31 , 2015 increased $ 241.4 million , or 4.2 % , from december 31 , 2014 . the increase was primarily driven by increases in investment securities and loans and leases , partly offset by decreases in cash and cash equivalents . total loans and leases of $ 5.0 billion as of december 31 , 2015 increased $ 172.9 million , or 3.6 % , from december 31 , 2014 . the company 's commercial loan portfolios , which are comprised of commercial real estate loans and commercial loans and leases , continued to exhibit growth . the company 's commercial loan portfolios , which totaled $ 4.0 billion , or 80.8 % , of 23 total loans and leases as of december 31 , 2015 , increased $ 403.8 million , or 11.1 % , from $ 3.6 billion , or 75.4 % of total loans and leases , as of december 31 , 2014 . the $ 403.8 million increase in the commercial loan portfolios was partially offset by the $ 303.3 million decrease in the indirect automobile portfolio in 2015 due to the sale during the first quarter of 2015 of over 90 % of the indirect automobile portfolio . story_separator_special_tag the determination of the loans on which full collectability is not reasonably assured , the estimates of the fair value of the underlying collateral , and the assessment of economic and other conditions are subject to assumptions and judgments by management . valuation allowances could differ materially as a result of changes in , or different interpretations of , these assumptions and judgments . 25 management evaluates the adequacy of the allowance on a quarterly basis and reviews its conclusion as to the amount to be established with the audit committee and the board of directors . see note 7 , `` allowance for loan and lease losses , '' to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on how management determines the balance of the allowance for loan and lease losses for each portfolio and class of loans . goodwill goodwill is presumed to have an indefinite useful life and is tested at least annually for impairment . impairment exists when the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value . if fair value exceeds the carrying amount at the time of testing , goodwill is not considered impaired . quoted market prices in active markets are the best evidence of fair value and are considered to be used as the basis for measurement , when available . other acceptable valuation methods include present-value measurements based on multiples of earnings or revenues , or similar performance measures . differences in valuation techniques could result in materially different evaluations of impairment . in september 2011 , the fasb issued accounting standards update ( `` asu '' ) 2011-08 which provides guidance for companies when testing goodwill for impairment . the objective of the asu is to simplify how entities test goodwill for impairment . pursuant to the asu , entities may now assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the two-step goodwill impairment test . the more-likely-than-not threshold is defined as having a likelihood of more than 50 % . to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount , an entity should consider the extent to which each of the adverse events or circumstances identified could affect the comparison of a reporting unit 's fair value with its carrying amount . pursuant to the asu , an entity should place more weight on the events and circumstances that have the greatest impact on a reporting unit 's fair value or the carrying amount of its net assets ; and may affect its determination of whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount . qualitative factors that have been assessed to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount including goodwill : general economic conditions , regulatory environment , share price , real estate values , lending concentrations , interest-rate environment , asset quality , capital , financial performance , integration of acquired companies and conversion to a new data processing system . the company has evaluated the qualitative factors discussed above and assessed the effect identified adverse events or circumstances could have , and based on this analysis has concluded there was no indication of goodwill impairment as of december 31 , 2015 . further analysis of the company 's goodwill can be found in note 9 “ goodwill and other intangible assets ” within notes to the consolidated financial statements . identified intangible assets identified intangible assets are assets resulting from acquisitions that are being amortized over their estimated useful lives . the recoverability of identified intangible assets is evaluated for impairment at least annually . if impairment is deemed to have occurred , the amount of impairment is charged to expense when identified . income taxes certain areas of accounting for income taxes require management 's judgment , including determining the expected realization of deferred tax assets and the adequacy of liabilities for uncertain tax positions . judgments are made regarding various tax positions , which are often subjective and involve assumptions about items that are inherently uncertain . if actual factors and conditions differ materially from estimates made by management , the actual realization of the net deferred tax assets or liabilities for uncertain tax positions could vary materially from the amounts previously recorded . deferred tax assets arise from items that may be claimed as a tax deduction or credit in future income tax returns , for which a financial statement tax benefit has been recognized . the company 's realization of the deferred tax asset depends upon future levels of its taxable income and the existence of prior years ' taxable income for which claims for refunds can be carried back . where necessary , valuation allowances are recorded against those deferred tax assets which a company has determined will not be realized . deferred tax liabilities represent items that will require a future tax payment . deferred tax liabilities generally represent tax expense recognized in the company 's financial statements for which payment has been deferred , or a deduction claimed on the company 's tax return but not yet recognized as an expense in the company 's financial statements . deferred tax liabilities are also recognized for certain non-cash items such as goodwill . recent accounting developments 26 see note 1 , “ basis of presentation ” within notes to the consolidated financial statements for information regarding recent accounting developments .
","results for 2015 included a $ 7.5 million provision for credit losses , discussed in the `` allowance for credit losses—allowance for loan and lease losses '' section below . 24 non-interest income remained consistent at $ 20.2 million for the year ended december 31 , 2015 and december 31 , 2014 . several factors contributed to the year over year increase , including an increase of $ 2.5 million in loan level derivative income , an increase of $ 0.6 million in gain on sales of loans and leases held-for-sale , offset by a decrease of $ 1.5 million in gain on sale of premises and equipment , and a decrease of $ 1.7 million in other non-interest income . non-interest expense decreased $ 3.8 million , to $ 125.4 million for the year ended december 31 , 2015 from $ 129.2 million for the year ended december 31 , 2014 . the decrease was largely attributable to a decrease of $ 2.2 million in equipment and data processing , a decrease of $ 1.2 million in professional services , and a decrease of $ 0.5 million in compensation and employee benefit expense . critical accounting policies the accounting policies described below are considered critical to understanding the company 's financial condition and operating results . such accounting policies are considered to be especially important because they involve a higher degree of complexity and require management to make difficult and subjective judgments which often require assumptions or estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain . the use of different judgments , assumptions and estimates could result in material differences in the company 's operating results or financial condition . investment securities investment securities classified as available-for-sale are carried at estimated fair value , with any unrealized gains and losses , net of taxes , reported as accumulated other comprehensive income or loss in stockholders ' equity .

of this annual report to gain an understanding of the important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our forward-looking statements . please also see the section entitled “ special note regarding forward-looking statements. ” management 's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ( md & a ) is designed to provide material information relevant to an assessment of the company 's financial condition and results of operations , including an evaluation of the amounts and certainty of cash flows from operations and from outside sources . this section is designed to focus on material events and uncertainties known to management that are reasonably likely to cause reported financial information not to be necessarily indicative of future operating results or of future financial condition . this includes descriptions and amounts of matters that have had a material impact on reported operations , as well as matters that are reasonably likely based on management 's assessment to have a material impact on future operations . overview our primary focus is to transform diagnostic testing through innovative molecular diagnostic products that enable customers to deploy accurate , reliable , low cost and rapid molecular testing at the point-of-care for infectious diseases and other conditions . we are developing the talis one system ( talis one , the talis one system or platform ) , that leverages expertise across chemistry , biology , engineering and software , to create a fully integrated , and cloud-enabled , portable molecular diagnostic solution that customers can rapidly deploy when are where needed . the talis one system incorporates core proprietary technologies into a compact , easy-to-use instrument , that utilizes single use test cartridges and software , including a central cloud database , which are designed to work together to provide levels of testing accuracy equivalent to a central laboratory . we intend to commercialize talis one system as an integrated system comprising single use consumables , an instrument and software . our commercial strategy will focus on building and expanding an installed base of talis one instruments and driving utilization of our talis one assay kits to generate revenue from the purchase of such products . subject to marketing authorization , our first commercial test will be a rapid point-of-care molecular diagnostic to detect sars-cov-2 directly from a patient sample in less than 30 minutes ( covid-19 test ) . we are also developing assays for the detection of other respiratory infections that could be included as a panel test with our covid-19 test as well as tests for infections related to women 's health and sexually transmitted infections . our products will require marketing authorization from the fda prior to commercialization . due to the covid-19 global pandemic , we plan to pursue marketing authorization for our covid-19 test under an eua rather than initially pursuing 510 ( k ) clearance or other forms of marketing authorization under the fda 's standard medical device authorities . we have invested in automated cartridge manufacturing lines capable of producing one million talis one cartridges per month for the covid-19 assay , which are scheduled to begin to come on-line in the first quarter of 2021 and we expect will scale to full capacity through 2021. these manufacturing lines will be located at our contract manufacturers ' sites and operated by our contract manufacturing partners . we have also ordered 5,000 talis one instruments from our instrument contract manufacturer through the first half of 2021. since our inception in 2013 , we have devoted substantially all our efforts to research and development activities , manufacturing capabilities , raising capital , building our intellectual property portfolio and providing general and administrative support for these operations . we have principally financed our operations through the 91 issuance and sale of shares of our convertible preferred stock to outside investors in private equity financings as well as the issuance of convertible promissory notes and receipts from government grants . prior to our initial public offering we received $ 351.5 million from investors in our preferred stock financings and the sale of convertible promissory notes that converted in such financings . additionally , on february 1 7 , 2021 , the company raise d $ 232.6 million through an initial public offering to finance operations going forward . we have incurred recurring losses since our inception , including net losses of $ 91.1 million and $ 27.5 million for the years ended december 31 , 2020 and 2019 , respectively . as of december 31 , 2020 , we had an accumulated deficit of $ 172.9 million . story_separator_special_tag we are continuing to assess the impact of the covid-19 pandemic on our current and future business and operations , including our expenses and planned clinical trial and other development timelines , as well as on our industry and the healthcare system . as a result of the covid-19 pandemic , or similar pandemics and outbreaks , we have and may in the future experience severe disruptions , including : interruption of or delays in receiving products and supplies from the third parties we rely on to , among other things , manufacture components of our instruments , due to staffing shortages , production slowdowns or stoppages and disruptions in delivery systems , which may impair our ability to sell our products and consumables ; limitations on our business operations by the local , state , or federal government that could impact our ability to sell or deliver our instruments and consumables ; delays in customers ' purchasing decisions and negotiations with customers and potential customers ; business disruptions caused by workplace , laboratory and office closures and an increased reliance on employees working from home , travel limitations , cyber security and data accessibility limits , or communication or mass transit disruptions ; and limitations on employee resources that would otherwise be focused on the conduct of our activities , including because of sickness of employees or their families or the desire of employees to avoid contact with large groups of people . three vaccines for covid-19 have been authorized for emergency use by the fda as of march 2021. while we do not foresee the authorizations having an immediate and near-term impact on the demand for covid-19 tests , the vaccines could reduce the future demand for such tests depending on the effectiveness of the vaccines . 93 components of our results of operations revenue to date , we have not generated any revenue from sales of our talis one system . if our development efforts for our system are successful and result in regulatory approval , we expect to generate revenue in the future from product sales of our talis one instruments and single use cartridges . our business model is focused on driving the adoption of the talis one system . customers would gain access to our instrument via a direct sales model or a reagent rental model . under direct platform sales , our customers would directly purchase our talis one instrument and make subsequent independent purchases of our cartridges . this would include , during our early customer engagements , a fully paid workflow license to practice the desired workflow ( s ) in a specific field of use . in addition , we would also offer platform support to the extent customers require further system and workflow optimization following platform implementation . when we place a system under a reagent rental agreement , we plan to install equipment in the customer 's facility without a fee and the customer agrees to purchase our cartridges at a stated price over the term of the reagent rental agreement . some of these agreements could include minimum purchase commitments . under a reagent rental model , we plan to retain title to the equipment and such title is transferred to the customer at no additional charge at the conclusion of the initial arrangement . the cost of the instrument under the agreement is expected to be recovered in the fees charged for consumables , to the extent sold , over the term of the agreement . we can not predict if , when , or to what extent we will generate revenue from the commercialization and sale of our system . we may never succeed in obtaining regulatory approval for our system . growth and predictability of recurring revenue is impacted by the mix between these options . it is our goal and expectation that recurring revenue will grow over time , both in absolute dollars and as a percentage of our revenue . grant revenue to date , all of our revenue has been derived from government grants , which includes an april 2018 subaward grant from boston university as part of the carb-x initiative , a may 2018 grant from the nih to support our advancement of a diagnostics via rapid enrichment , identification , and phenotypic antibiotic susceptibility testing of pathogens from blood project ( nih grant ) , a july 2020 subaward grant from the university of massachusetts medical school for phase 1 of the nih 's radx initiative and a $ 25.4 million contract from the nih directly for phase 2 of the radx initiative . the carb-x , nih grant and radx initiative included initial funding of $ 4.4 million through september 2019 , $ 1.3 million through april 2019 , and $ 10.1 million based on achieving certain milestones , respectively . the initial funding term of the carb-x grant was extended through september 30 , 2020 and our initial funding was increased by $ 1.2 million . we also exercised our second one-year option under the nih grant , extending the term through april 30 , 2021. under the carb-x and nih grant there is the possibility of an additional $ 2.8 million of funding through june 2021 and an additional $ 2.2 million of funding through april 2023 , respectively . under radx there is the possibility of an additional $ 16.5 million of funding through july 2021. these grants are not in scope of accounting standards update ( asu ) no . 2014-09 , revenue from contracts with customers ( asc 606 ) as the government entities and or government-sponsored entities are not customers under the agreements . grant funds received from third parties are recorded as revenue if we are deemed to be the principal participant in the arrangement . if we are not the principal participant , the funds from grants are recorded as a reduction to research and development expense . reimbursable costs paid prior to being billed are recorded as unbilled grant receivables .

"we earn revenues from the delivery of natural gas , but do not earn a profit on the natural gas that we deliver , as those costs are passed through to our customers at cost . the primary components of our revenue requirements are the amount of capital invested in our business , which is also known as rate base , our allowed rate of return on our capital investments and our recoverable operating expenses , including depreciation and income taxes . our rates have both a fixed and a variable component , with approximately 71 percent and 69 percent of our natural gas sales net margin in 2014 and 2013 , respectively , derived from fixed monthly charges to our customers . the variable component of our rates is dependent on the consumption of natural gas , which is impacted primarily by the weather and , to a lesser extent , economic activity . while we have weather normalization mechanisms in most jurisdictions , which adjust customers ' bills when the actual heating degree days differ from normalized heating degree days , these mechanisms are in place for only a portion of the year and do not offset all fluctuations in usage resulting from weather variability . accordingly , the weather can have either a positive or negative impact on our financial performance . our financial performance is thus contingent on a number of factors , including : ( 1 ) regulatory outcomes , which dictate the returns we are authorized to earn and the rates we are allowed to charge for our service ; ( 2 ) the performance of the financial markets , which influences the rates of return authorized by our regulators ; ( 3 ) the consumption of natural gas , which impacts the amount of our net margin derived from the variable component of our rates ; ( 4 ) our operating performance , which impacts our operating expenses ; and ( 5 ) the perceived value of natural gas relative to other energy sources , particularly electricity , which influences our customers ' choice of natural gas to provide a portion of their energy needs . we are subject to regulatory requirements for pipeline safety and environmental compliance . these requirements impact our operating expenses and the level of capital expenditures required for compliance . historically , our regulators have allowed recovery of these expenditures . however , we are unable to predict the impact that new regulatory requirements will have on our operating expenses or the level of our capital expenditures . although we believe our regulators will continue to allow recovery of such expenditures in the future , we can not be assured of that outcome . recent developments distribution - on january 8 , 2014 , oneok 's board of directors approved the distribution of all the shares of our common stock to holders of oneok common stock . in order to allow oneok to effect the distribution , we requested , and the sec declared effective , our registration statement on form 10 on january 10 , 2014. oneok transferred all of the assets and liabilities primarily related to its natural gas distribution business to us . assets and liabilities included accounts receivable and payable , natural gas in storage , regulatory assets and liabilities , pipeline and other natural gas distribution facilities , customer deposits , employee-related assets and liabilities , including amounts attributable to pension and other postretirement benefits , tax-related assets and liabilities and other assets and liabilities primarily associated with providing natural gas distribution service in oklahoma , kansas and texas . cash and certain corporate assets , such as office space in the corporate headquarters and certain it hardware and software , were not transferred to us ; however , the transition services agreement between oneok and us provided temporary access to such corporate assets as necessary to operate our business prior to obtaining the applicable corporate assets on our own . immediately prior to the contribution of the natural gas distribution business to us , oneok contributed to the capital of the natural gas distribution business all of the amounts outstanding on the natural gas distribution business ' short-term note payable to and long-term line of credit with oneok . we received approximately $ 1.19 billion of cash from a private placement of senior notes , which were later exchanged for registered notes , then used a portion of those proceeds to fund a cash payment of approximately $ 1.13 billion to oneok . on january 31 , 2014 , oneok distributed one share of our common stock for every four shares of oneok common stock held by oneok shareholders of record as of the close of business on january 21 , 2014 , the record date of the distribution . at the close of business on january 31 , 2014 , one gas , inc. became an independent , publicly traded company as a result of the distribution . our common stock began trading “ regular-way ” under the ticker symbol “ ogs ” on the nyse on february 3 , 2014 . 28 in december 2013 , we entered into a $ 700 million revolving credit agreement , which became effective upon the separation . dividend - in 2014 , we paid dividends totaling $ 0.84 per share ( $ 0.28 per share in each of our second , third and fourth quarters ) on our common stock . in january 2015 , a dividend of $ 0.30 per share ( $ 1.20 per share on an annualized basis ) was declared for shareholders of record on february 20 , 2015 , payable march 2 , 2015. regulatory activities oklahoma - in october 2013 , oklahoma natural gas , together with the public utility division of the occ , filed a joint application to postpone its 2014 rate case . story_separator_special_tag the eparr provides for a streamlined review of texas gas service 's revenue requirement based upon an agreed upon capital structure and return on equity . in april 2014 , texas gas service filed under the eparr for an increase in revenues in the city of el paso , and under the grip statute for the remainder of the el paso service area . in july 2014 , the city of el paso approved an annual increase in revenues of $ 3.5 million , resulting from the eparr filing . the grip filing for the remainder of the el paso service area was approved with an increase in revenues of $ 0.6 million . texas gas service filed requests for interim rate relief under the grip statute with the city of austin , texas , and surrounding communities in february 2014 for approximately $ 5.2 million . the city councils approved the requested increase effective may 2014. texas gas service filed requests for interim rate relief under the grip statute with the cities of austin , texas , and surrounding communities in february 2013 and with el paso , texas , in april 2013 for approximately $ 4.1 million and $ 4.9 million , respectively . in may 2013 , the city of austin approved the requested increase . in july 2013 , the city of el paso denied texas gas service 's grip request , which texas gas service appealed to the rrc . in september 2013 , the rrc approved texas gas service 's requested increase . texas gas service filed requests for interim rate relief under the grip statute with the cities of austin , texas , and surrounding communities in february 2012 and with el paso , texas , in april 2012 for approximately $ 3.5 million and $ 1.9 million , respectively . in may 2012 , the city of austin approved the requested increase . in july 2012 , the city of el paso approved an increase of $ 1.3 million . in the normal course of business , texas gas service has filed rate cases and sought grip and cost-of-service adjustments in various other texas jurisdictions to address investments in rate base and changes in expense . annual rate increases totaling $ 4.0 million , $ 4.2 million and $ 10.1 million associated with these filings were approved in 2014 , 2013 and 2012 , respectively . general - certain costs to be recovered through the ratemaking process have been capitalized as regulatory assets . should recovery cease due to regulatory actions , certain of these assets may no longer meet the criteria for recognition and accordingly , a writeoff of regulatory assets and stranded costs may be required . in 2013 , as part of the kcc settlement for the separation of our kansas gas service assets from oneok , we expensed $ 10.2 million for the remaining balance of certain costs associated with oneok 's acquisition of kansas gas service in 1997. there were no writeoffs of regulatory assets resulting from the failure to meet the criteria for capitalization during 2014 or 2012 . 30 story_separator_special_tag style= '' padding-left:0px ;

30-year average for years 1981-2010 published by the national oceanic and atmospheric administration , as calculated using 13 weather stations across kansas and weighted on hdds by weather station and customers for kansas ; and hdds , which are used primarily in the weather normalization billing calculations for each service area of texas , are weighted using a rolling 10-year average of actual natural gas distribution sales volumes by service area for texas . actual hdds are based on quarter-to-date and year-to-date , weighted average of : 11 weather stations and customers by month for oklahoma ; 13 weather stations and customers by month for kansas ; and 9 weather stations and natural gas distribution sales volumes by service area for texas . contingencies legal proceedings - we are a party to various litigation matters and claims that have arisen in the normal course of our operations . while the results of litigation and claims can not be predicted with certainty , we believe the reasonably possible losses from such matters , individually and in the aggregate , are not material . additionally , we believe the probable final outcome of such matters will not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations , financial position or cash flows . liquidity and capital resources general - from the date of the separation , we have funded operating expenses , working capital requirements , including purchases of natural gas , and capital expenditures primarily with cash from operations , the retained proceeds from our private placement of senior notes in january 2014 and our commercial paper program . prior to the separation , we relied primarily on operating cash flow and participation in oneok 's cash management program for our liquidity and capital resource requirements .

"international home furnishings center in connection with the sale of our interest in international home furnishings center , inc. ( “ ihfc ” ) on may story_separator_special_tag ( amounts in thousands except share and per share data ) overview bassett is a leading retailer , manufacturer and marketer of branded home furnishings . our products are sold primarily through a network of company-owned and licensee-owned branded stores under the bassett home furnishings ( “ bhf ” ) name , with additional distribution through other wholesale channels including multi-line furniture stores , many of which feature bassett galleries or design centers , specialty stores and mass merchants . we were founded in 1902 and incorporated under the laws of virginia in 1930. our rich 113-year history has instilled the principles of quality , value , and integrity in everything that we do , while simultaneously providing us with the expertise to respond to ever-changing consumer tastes and to meet the demands of a global economy . with 93 bhf stores at november 28 , 2015 , we have leveraged our strong brand name in furniture into a network of corporate and licensed stores that focus on providing consumers with a friendly environment for buying furniture and accessories . we created our store program in 1997 to provide a single source home furnishings retail store that provides a unique combination of stylish , quality furniture and accessories with a high level of customer service . the store features custom order furniture ready for delivery in less than 30 days , more than 1,000 upholstery fabrics , free in-home design visits , and coordinated decorating accessories . we believe that our capabilities in custom upholstery have become unmatched in recent years . our manufacturing team takes great pride in the breadth of its options , the precision of its craftsmanship , and the speed of its delivery . the selling philosophy in the stores is based on building strong long-term relationships with each customer . sales people are referred to as design consultants and are each trained to evaluate customer needs and provide comprehensive solutions for their home decor . we continue to strengthen the sales and design talent within our company-owned retail stores . our design consultants undergo extensive design certification training . this training has strengthened their skills related to our house call and design business , and is intended to increase business with our most valuable customers . in order to reach markets that can not be effectively served by our retail store network , we also distribute our products through other wholesale channels including multi-line furniture stores , many of which feature bassett galleries or design centers , specialty stores and mass merchants . we use a network of over 25 independent sales representatives who have stated geographical territories . these sales representatives are compensated based on a standard commission rate . we believe this blended strategy provides us the greatest ability to effectively distribute our products throughout the united states and ultimately gain market share . for many years we owned 49 % of zenith freight lines , llc ( “ zenith ” ) . during that time the strategic significance of our partnership with zenith had risen to include the over-the-road transportation of furniture , the operation of regional freight terminal , warehouse and distribution facilities in eleven states , and the management of various home delivery facilities that service bassett home furnishings stores and other clients in local markets around the united states . on february 2 , 2015 , we acquired the remaining 51 % of zenith , which now operates as a wholly-owned subsidiary of bassett . our acquisition of zenith brings to our company the ability to deliver best-of-class shipping and logistical support services that are uniquely tailored to the needs of the furniture industry , as well as the ability to provide the expedited delivery service which is increasingly demanded by our industry . we believe that our ownership of zenith will not only enhance our own wholesale and retail distribution capabilities , but will provide additional growth opportunities as zenith continues to expand its service to other customers . in september of 2011 , we announced the formation of a strategic partnership with hgtv ( home and garden television ) , a division of scripps networks , llc , which combines our heritage in the furniture industry with the penetration of 96 million households in the united states that hgtv enjoys today . as part of this alliance , the in-store design centers have been co-branded with hgtv to more forcefully market the concept of a “ home makeover ” , an important point of differentiation for our stores that also mirrors much of the programming content on the hgtv network . we believe the new co-branded design centers coupled with the targeted national advertising on hgtv have played a key role in our improved comparable store sales since their introduction . in october of 2015 , we announced the extension of our partnership with hgtv through 2019. while continuing to feature hgtv branded custom upholstery products in our hgtv home design studios in bassett home furnishings stores , we will now expand the concept to select independent dealers . we believe this will provide additional growth outside our bhf store network . at november 28 , 2015 , our bfh store network included 60 company-owned stores and 33 licensee-owned stores . due to the improved operating performance of our retail network along with continued improvement in underlying economic factors such as the housing market and consumer confidence , we have been expanding our retail presence in various parts of the country . as part of this expansion we opened one new store and relocated two stores during fiscal 2015 while opening six new stores and relocating two stores in fiscal 2014. we plan to continue opening new stores , primarily in underpenetrated markets where we currently have stores . story_separator_special_tag net sales revenue , cost of furniture and accessories sold , selling , general and administrative ( sg & a ) expense , new store pre-opening costs , other charges

while fiscal 2015 and 2014 contained 52 weeks . on an average weekly basis , sales for 2014 increased 8.1 % over 2013. this trend primarily reflects the increase in the number of stores owned and operated by us , as well as growth in our wholesale shipments outside of our licensee network . our consolidated net sales by segment were as follows : replace_table_token_9_th operating income was $ 25,989 for 2015 as compared to $ 15,131 for 2014 and $ 10,005 for 2013. these increases have been primarily attributable to increased retail volume , the addition of zenith , which contributed an additional $ 3,528 of operating income for fiscal 2015 , and increased wholesale volume . other charges of $ 974 during fiscal 2015 include lease exit costs of $ 419 , asset impairment charges of $

described below : wholesale . the wholesale home furnishings segment is involved principally in the design , manufacture , sourcing , sale and distribution of furniture products to a network of bassett stores ( licensee-owned stores and company-owned stores ) and independent furniture retailers . our wholesale segment includes our wood and upholstery operations as well as all corporate selling , general and administrative expenses , including those corporate expenses related to both company- and licensee-owned stores . we eliminate the sales between our wholesale and retail segments

stores and includes the revenues , expenses , assets and liabilities ( including real estate ) and capital expenditures directly related to these stores . logistical services . with our acquisition of zenith on february 2 , 2015 , we created the logistical services operating segment which reflects the operations of zenith . in addition to providing shipping , delivery and warehousing services for the company , zenith also provides similar services to other customers , primarily in the furniture industry . revenue from the performance of these services to other customers is included in logistics revenue in our consolidated statement of income . zenith 's operating costs are included in selling , general and administrative expenses . amounts charged by zenith to the company for transportation and logistical services prior to february 2 , 2015 are included in selling , general and administrative expenses , and our equity in the earnings of zenith prior to the date of

investments , our holdings of retail real estate previously leased as licensee stores , and our former equity investment in zenith prior to acquisition . this segment has been eliminated and the assets formerly reported therein are now considered to be part of our wholesale segment . the earnings and costs associated with these assets , including our equity in the income of zenith prior to the date of acquisition , will continue to be included in other loss , net , in our condensed consolidated statements of income . 17 the following tables illustrate the effects of various intercompany

the asia-pacific ( or pan-pacific ) area , consisting of royal wolf ( which leases and sells storage containers , portable container buildings and freight containers in australia and new zealand ) and north america , consisting of pac-van ( which leases and sells storage , office and portable liquid storage tank containers , modular buildings and mobile offices ) , and lone star ( see above ) , which are combined to form our north american leasing operations , and southern frac ( which manufactures portable liquid storage tank containers ) . as of june 30 , 2015 , our two geographic leasing operations lease and sell their products through twenty customer service centers ( cscs ) in australia , nine cscs in new zealand , thirty-nine branch locations in the united states and two branch locations in canada . at that date , we had 266 and 545 employees and 41,742 and 31,114 lease fleet units in the asia-pacific area and north america , respectively . our lease fleet is comprised of three distinct specialty rental equipment categories that possess attractive asset characteristics and serve our customers ' on-site temporary needs and applications . these categories match the sectors comprising the portable services industry . our portable storage category is segmented into two products : ( 1 ) storage containers , which primarily consist of new and used steel shipping containers under international organization for standardization ( iso ) standards , that provide a flexible , low cost alternative to warehousing , while offering greater security , convenience and immediate accessibility ; and ( 2 ) freight containers , which are either designed for transport of products by road and rail and are only offered in our asia-pacific territory . our modular space category is segmented into three products : ( 1 ) office containers , which are referred to as portable container buildings in the asia-pacific , are either modified or specifically manufactured containers that provide self-contained office space with maximum design flexibility . office containers in the united states are oftentimes referred to as ground level offices ( glos ) ; ( 2 ) modular buildings , which provide customers with flexible space solutions and are often modified to customer specifications and ( 3 ) mobile offices , which are re-locatable units with aluminum or wood exteriors and wood ( or steel ) frames on a steel carriage fitted with axles , and which allow for an assortment of add-ons to provide convenient temporary space solutions . ii-6 our liquid containment category includes portable liquid storage tanks that are manufactured 500-barrel capacity steel containers with fixed axles for transport . these units are regularly utilized for a variety of applications across a wide range of industries , including refinery , petrochemical and industrial plant maintenance , oil and gas services , environmental remediation and field services , infrastructure building construction , marine services , pipeline construction and maintenance , tank terminal services , waste management , wastewater treatment and landfill services . story_separator_special_tag during fy 2015 from 41 % during fy 2014 due primarily to operating expenses at our north american leasing operations ( principally lone star ) not proportionately decreasing with lower revenues caused by the reduced demand in the oil and gas market . fy 2015 also includes $ 365,000 related to expenses of a public equity offering that was postponed during the fourth quarter . in addition , as discussed above , there were over $ 11.0 million of sales to a freight logistics customer which , if excluded , would show these costs as a percentage of revenues in fy 2014 at approximately 43 % . this is more comparable to fy 2015 , particularly since infrastructure costs in north america , as a percentage of revenues , have proportionally increased in order to support anticipated business growth in other sectors . depreciation and amortization . depreciation and amortization increased by $ 11.3 million to $ 37.7 million in fy 2015 from $ 26.4 million in fy 2014 , primarily as a result of our increasing investment in the lease fleet and business acquisitions . interest expense . interest expense of $ 21.1 million in fy 2015 was $ 9.1 million higher than the $ 12.0 million in fy 2014 , primarily in north america , which increased by $ 9.6 million . story_separator_special_tag overall , non-manufacturing sales increased by $ 13.5 million , or 13 % , in fy 2014 from fy 2013. the increase at royal wolf was comprised of an increase of $ 15.2 million ( $ 4.8 million increase due to higher unit sales , $ 13.8 million increase due to average price increases and a $ 3.4 million decrease due to foreign exchange movements ) in the national accounts group and a decrease of $ 6.6 million ( $ 6.4 million decrease due to foreign exchange movements , $ 2.3 million decrease due to average price decreases and a $ 2.1 million increase due to higher unit sales ) in the csc operations . sales in the national accounts group during fy 2014 included over $ 11.0 million ( over aus $ 12.0 million ) to one customer , a freight logistics company that operates a national rail network . the operating margin of the over aus $ 12.0 million sales contract with this customer was below 10 % . at pac-van , the higher sales in fy 2014 versus fy 2013 were primarily due to increases in the commercial , industrial , mining and energy and education sectors , which increased by an aggregate of $ 6.2 million , and were offset somewhat by decreases in the services , construction and government sectors totaling $ 1.6 million . at southern frac , portable liquid storage tank container sales in fy 2014 consisted of 568 units sold at an average sales price of approximately $ 34,600 per unit versus 577 units sold at an average sales price of approximately $ 33,200 per unit during fy 2013. stronger drilling activity in texas , offset substantially by a greater proportion of intercompany sales to pac-van and lone star , in fy 2014 when compared to fy 2013 , were the primary reasons for the increase in manufacturing revenues . leasing revenues during fy 2014 totaled $ 151.0 million , as compared to $ 123.4 million during fy 2013 , representing an increase of $ 27.6 million , or 22 % . leasing revenues increased by $ 27.8 million , or 57 % , in our north american leasing operations ; consisting of an increase at pac-van of $ 13.1 million , or 27 % , and lone star generated ii-9 $ 14.7 million of leasing revenues during the fourth quarter of fy 2014. in the asia-pacific area , royal wolf 's leasing revenues decreased slightly by $ 0.2 million . in australian dollars , however , fy 2014 leasing revenues at royal wolf actually increased by 12 % from fy 2013. at royal wolf , average utilization in the retail and the national accounts group operations were 85 % and 75 % , respectively , during fy 2014 , an increase from 84 % and 74 % in fy 2013 , respectively . the overall average utilization increased slightly in fy 2014 to 82.4 % from 81.8 % in fy 2013 ; and the average monthly lease rate of containers was aus $ 177 in fy 2014 versus aus $ 164 in fy 2013. leasing revenues in fy 2014 increased over fy 2013 in local currency due primarily to the combination of higher monthly lease rates and the average monthly number of units on lease being more than 1,875 higher in fy 2014 as compared to fy 2013. we believe the primary reasons we are generally able to maintain high average utilization rates and increase our average units on lease and monthly rate between periods at royal wolf was the generally stable economy in the asia-pacific area and our position as the only company with a national footprint of container products in the mobile storage and modular space sectors in australia and new zealand . we regularly review each local market in which we do business to determine if local factors justify increases or decreases in lease rates and the effect these changes would have on utilization and revenues . at pac-van , average utilization rates were 79 % , 83 % , 85 % , 69 % and 73 % and average monthly lease rates were $ 111 , $ 275 , $ 872 , $ 243 and $ 824 for storage containers , office containers , frac tank containers , mobile offices and modular units , respectively , during fy 2014 ; as compared to average utilization rates of 82 % , 82 % , 87 % , 67 % and 75 % and average monthly lease rates of $ 105 , $ 262 , $ 965 , $ 236 and $ 843 in fy 2013 , respectively . the average composite utilization rate increased to 77 % in fy 2014 from 76 % in fy 2013 , and the composite average monthly number of units on lease was nearly 3,200 higher in fy 2014 as compared to fy 2013. the strong utilization , higher average monthly number of units on lease and generally higher monthly lease rates resulted primarily from improved demand across most sectors , particularly in the mining and energy , commercial , construction , industrial and retail sectors , which increased by an aggregate of $ 14.2 million . during the fourth quarter of fy 2014 , lone star 's average utilization rate was 87 % and its average monthly lease rate was over $ 1,900. cost of sales . cost of sales from our lease inventories and fleet ( which is the cost related to our sales revenues only and exclusive of the line items discussed below ) increased by $ 13.0 million from $ 75.1 million during fy 2013 to $ 88.1 million during fy 2014 , as a result of the higher sales discussed above . our gross profit percentage from these non-manufacturing sales decreased to 24 % in fy 2014 from 27 % in fy 2013 due primarily to the lower margin on the sales to a royal wolf freight logistics customer , as discussed above .
","results of operations year ended june 30 , 2015 ( fy 2015 ) compared to year ended june 30 , 2014 ( fy 2014 ) the following compares our fy 2015 results of operations with our fy 2014 results of operations . revenues . revenues increased $ 16.7 million , or 6 % , to $ 303.8 million in fy 2015 from $ 287.1 million in fy 2014. this consisted of a $ 60.3 million increase , or 57 % , in revenues in our north american leasing operations , a decrease of $ 38.0 million , or 24 % , in revenues in the asia-pacific area and a decrease of $ 5.6 million , or 29 % , in manufacturing revenues . excluding the impact of lone star , which we acquired on april 7 , 2014 and contributed revenues of $ 44.5 million in the first nine months of fy 2015 , revenues in our north american leasing operations increased by 15 % from fy 2014. the average currency exchange rate of the weakening australian dollar relative to the u.s. dollar in fy 2015 versus fy 2014 adversely effected the translation of revenues from the asia-pacific area . the average currency exchange rate of one australian dollar during fy 2015 was $ 0.8373 u.s. dollar compared to $ 0.9183 u.s. dollar during fy 2014. in australian dollars , total revenues in the asia-pacific area decreased by 16 % . excluding lone star ( doing business in the oil and gas sector ) for the first nine months of fy 2015 , the north american leasing revenue increase in fy 2015 from fy 2014 of $ 15.8 million was broadly across most sectors , but particularly in the commercial , retail , construction and industrial sectors , where revenues increased between the periods by an aggregate of $ 23.9 million ; offset somewhat by decreases in the oil and gas and education sectors totaling $ 9.1 million .

"story_separator_special_tag the following should be read in conjunction with part i , including the matters set forth in the risk factors section of this report , and our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this report . overview we are the largest recreational boat retailer in the united states with fiscal 2012 revenue in excess of $ 520 million . through our current 53 retail locations in 18 states , we sell new and used recreational boats and related marine products , including engines , trailers , parts , and accessories . we also arrange related boat financing , insurance , and extended service contracts ; provide boat repair and maintenance services ; offer yacht and boat brokerage services ; and , where available , offer slip and storage accommodations . we recently implemented programs to increase substantially our sale over the internet of used boats and a wide range of boating parts , accessories , supplies , and products ; the sale of boats , boating parts , and accessories , as well as the offer of finance and insurance , or f & i , products at various offsite locations ; and the charter of power and sailing yachts in the british virgin islands . none of these recently implemented programs have had a material effect on our consolidated financial statements . marinemax was incorporated in january 1998. we commenced operations with the acquisition of five independent recreational boat dealers on march 1 , 1998. since the initial acquisitions in march 1998 , we have acquired 22 recreational boat dealers , two boat brokerage operations , and two full-service yacht repair facilities . as a part of our acquisition strategy , we frequently engage in discussions with various recreational boat dealers regarding their potential acquisition by us . potential acquisition discussions frequently take place over a long period of time and involve difficult business integration and other issues , including , in some cases , management succession and related matters . as a result of these and other factors , a number of potential acquisitions that from time to time appear likely to occur do not result in binding legal agreements and are not consummated . we did not complete any acquisitions during the fiscal year ended september 30 , 2010 and completed a relatively small acquisition in each of the fiscal years ended september 30 , 2011 and 2012. general economic conditions and consumer spending patterns can negatively impact our operating results . unfavorable local , regional , national , or global economic developments or uncertainties regarding future economic prospects could reduce consumer spending in the markets we serve and adversely affect our business . economic conditions in areas in which we operate dealerships , particularly florida in which we generated 54 % , 50 % , and 49 % of our revenue during fiscal 2010 , 2011 , and 2012 , respectively , can have a major impact on our operations . local influences , such as corporate downsizing , military base closings , inclement weather , environmental conditions , and specific events , such as the bp oil spill in the gulf of mexico , also could adversely affect our operations in certain markets . in an economic downturn , consumer discretionary spending levels generally decline , at times resulting in disproportionately large reductions in the sale of luxury goods . consumer spending on luxury goods also may decline as a result of lower consumer confidence levels , even if prevailing economic conditions are favorable . although we have expanded our operations during periods of stagnant or modestly declining industry trends , the cyclical nature of the recreational boating industry or the lack of industry growth may adversely affect our business , financial condition , and results of operations . any period of adverse economic conditions or low consumer confidence has a negative effect on our business . lower consumer spending resulting from a downturn in the housing market and other economic factors adversely affected our business in fiscal 2007 , and continued weakness in consumer spending resulting from substantial weakness in the financial markets and depressed economic conditions had a very substantial negative effect on our business in each subsequent fiscal year , including 2012. these conditions caused us to substantially reduce our acquisition program , delay new store openings , reduce our inventory purchases , engage in inventory reduction efforts , close a number of our retail locations , reduce our headcount , and amend and replace our credit facility . acquisitions and new store openings remain important strategies to our company , and we plan to resume our growth through these strategies when more normal economic conditions return . however , we can not predict the length or severity of these unfavorable economic or financial conditions or the extent to which they will continue to adversely affect our operating results nor can we predict the effectiveness of the measures we have taken to address this environment or whether additional measures will be necessary . 45 although economic conditions have adversely affected our operating results , we have capitalized on our core strengths to substantially outperform the industry , resulting in market share gains . our ability to capture such market share supports the alignment of our retailing strategies with the desires of consumers . we believe the steps we have taken to address weak market conditions will yield an increase in future revenue . as general economic trends improve , we expect our core strengths and retailing strategies will position us to capitalize on growth opportunities as they occur and will allow us to emerge from this challenging economic environment with greater earnings potential . application of critical accounting policies we have identified the policies below as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations . the impact and risks related to these policies on our business operations is discussed throughout management 's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations when such policies affect our reported and expected financial results . story_separator_special_tag any impairment recognized in accordance with asc 360-10-40 is permanent and may not be restored . as of september 30 , 2012 , we had not recognized any impairment of long-lived assets in connection with asc 360-10-40 based on our reviews . stock-based compensation we account for our stock-based compensation plans following the provisions of fasb accounting standards codification 718 , compensation  stock compensation ( asc 718 ) . in accordance with asc 718 , we use the black-scholes valuation model for valuing all stock-based compensation and shares purchased under our employee stock purchase plan . we measure compensation for restricted stock awards and restricted stock units at fair value on the grant date based on the number of shares expected to vest and the quoted market price of our common stock . for restricted stock units with market conditions , we utilize a monte carlo simulation embedded in a lattice model to determine the fair value . we recognize compensation cost for all awards in earnings , net of estimated forfeitures , on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period for each separately vesting portion of the award . income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with fasb accounting standards codification 740 , income taxes ( asc 740 ) . under asc 740 , we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis . we measure deferred tax assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which we expect those temporary differences to be recovered or settled . we record valuation allowances to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized by considering all available positive and negative evidence . 47 pursuant to asc 740 , we must consider all positive and negative evidence regarding the realization of deferred tax assets , including past operating results and future sources of taxable income . under the provisions of asc 740-10 , we determined that our net deferred tax asset needed to be fully reserved given recent earnings and industry trends . the worker , homeownership , and business assistance act of 2009 was signed into law in november 2009. this act allowed us to carryback our 2009 net operating loss , which had a valuation allowance recorded against the entire amount and which we were not able to carryback under the prior tax law . the additional carryback generated a tax refund of $ 19.2 million . the tax refund was recorded as income tax benefit during our quarter ended december 31 , 2009 , the period in which this act was enacted . we filed a carryback claim with the internal revenue service , and we received a $ 19.2 million refund in the quarter ended march 31 , 2010. for a more comprehensive list of our accounting policies , including those which involve varying degrees of judgment , see note 2  significant accounting policies of notes to consolidated financial statements . story_separator_special_tag in which this act was enacted . we filed a carryback claim with the internal revenue service , and we received a $ 19.2 million refund in the quarter ended march 31 , 2010 . 49 quarterly data and seasonality our business , as well as the entire recreational boating industry , is highly seasonal , with seasonality varying in different geographic markets . with the exception of florida , we generally realize significantly lower sales and higher levels of inventories , and related short-term borrowings , in the quarterly periods ending december 31 and march 31. the onset of the public boat and recreation shows in january stimulates boat sales and typically allows us to reduce our inventory levels and related short-term borrowings throughout the remainder of the fiscal year . our business could become substantially more seasonal if we acquire dealers that operate in colder regions of the united states or close retail locations in warm climates . our business is also subject to weather patterns , which may adversely affect our results of operations . for example , drought conditions ( or merely reduced rainfall levels ) or excessive rain , may close area boating locations or render boating dangerous or inconvenient , thereby curtailing customer demand for our products and services . in addition , unseasonably cool weather and prolonged winter conditions may lead to a shorter selling season in certain locations . hurricanes and other storms could result in disruptions of our operations or damage to our boat inventories and facilities , as has been the case when florida and other markets were affected by hurricanes . although our geographic diversity is likely to reduce the overall impact to us of adverse weather conditions in any one market area , these conditions will continue to represent potential , material adverse risks to us and our future financial performance . liquidity and capital resources our cash needs are primarily for working capital to support operations , including new and used boat and related parts inventories , off-season liquidity , and growth through acquisitions and new store openings . acquisitions and new store openings remain important strategies to our company , and we plan to resume our growth through these strategies when more normal economic conditions return . however , we can not predict the length or severity of these unfavorable economic or financial conditions . we regularly monitor the aging of our inventories and current market trends to evaluate our current and future inventory needs . we also use this evaluation in conjunction with our review of our current and expected operating performance and expected business levels to determine the adequacy of our financing needs . these cash needs have historically been financed with cash generated from operations and borrowings under our credit facilities . our ability to utilize our credit facilities to fund operations depends upon the collateral levels and compliance with the covenants of the credit facilities .
","results of operations the following table sets forth certain financial data as a percentage of revenue for the periods indicated : replace_table_token_8_th fiscal year ended september 30 , 2012 compared with fiscal year ended september 30 , 2011 revenue . revenue increased $ 43.6 million , or 9.1 % , to $ 524.5 million for the fiscal year ended september 30 , 2012 from $ 480.9 million for the fiscal year ended september 30 , 2011. of this increase , $ 53.0 million was attributable to an 11 % increase in comparable-store sales , which was partially offset by a decline of $ 9.4 million related to stores opened or closed that were not eligible for inclusion in the comparable-store base for the 12 months ended september 30 , 2012. the increase in our comparable-store sales was due to incremental increases in new boat sales , partly attributable to new brands we have expanded with , and incremental increases in used boat sales , brokerage services , f & i products , service , parts and accessories . improving industry conditions resulting from improved economic conditions contributed to our comparable-store sales growth . gross profit . gross profit increased $ 13.8 million , or 11.5 % , to $ 133.3 million for the fiscal year ended september 30 , 2012 from $ 119.5 million for the fiscal year ended september 30 , 2011. gross profit as a percentage of revenue increased to 25.4 % for the fiscal year ended september 30 , 2012 from 24.9 % for the fiscal year ended september 30 , 2011. the increase in gross profit was primarily attributable to the increase in comparable-store sales and incrementally increased margins on new boat sales due to improving industry inventory conditions . selling , general , and administrative expenses .

we present background information and definitions that we believe are useful to understanding the discussion of our financial results . this information precedes the results of operations and is most beneficial when read in the sequence presented . a summary of key informational sections is as follows : “ executive summary ” contains the following sub-sections : “ overview ” provides information regarding our business , segments and results as discussed in the results of operations . “ background ” presents details of the company 's legal entity structure and key events that led up to the completion of the separation . “ industry trends and uncertainties ” discusses updates and changes to a number of trends and uncertainties that we believe may materially affect our future financial condition , results of operations or cash flows . “ summary of critical accounting estimates ” explains the most critical estimates and judgments applied in determining our gaap results . “ non-gaap and other financial disclosures ” defines key financial measures presented in the results of operations that are not calculated in accordance with gaap but are used by management in evaluating company and segment performance . as described in this section , adjusted earnings is presented by key business activities which are derived from , but different than , the line items presented in the gaap statement of operations . this section also refers to certain other terms used to describe our insurance business and financial and operating metrics but is not intended to be exhaustive . the results of operations section begins with two introductory sections to facilitate an understanding of the results discussion : “ significant business actions ” defines certain actions that had a significant impact to either or both net income ( loss ) available to shareholders and adjusted earnings , as defined in “ — non-gaap and other financial disclosures , ” which are not indicative of performance in the respective periods . events defined in this section are referred to in the results of operations discussion . “ annual actuarial review ” describes the changes in key assumptions applied in 2018 , 2017 and 2016 , respectively , resulting in an unfavorable impact to net income ( loss ) available to shareholders in each period . 86 certain amounts presented in prior periods within the foregoing discussions of our financial results have been reclassified to conform with the current year presentation . executive summary overview we are one of the largest providers of annuity and life insurance products in the united states through multiple independent distribution channels and marketing arrangements with a diverse network of distribution partners . for operating purposes , we have established three segments : ( i ) annuities , ( ii ) life and ( iii ) run-off , which consists of operations relating to products we are not actively selling , and which are separately managed . story_separator_special_tag in addition , the following factors represent some of the key general trends and uncertainties that have influenced the development of our business and our historical financial performance and that we believe will continue to influence our business and results of operations in the future . changes in accounting standards our financial statements are subject to the application of gaap , which is periodically revised by the fasb . the fasb exposed several proposed amendments to the accounting for long-duration insurance contracts in 2016 , and on august 15 , 2018 issued a final asu effective january 1 , 2021. the asu will result in significant changes to the accounting for long-duration insurance contracts , including a requirement for all guarantees associated with our variable annuity business to be measured at fair value . the company is in the early stages of evaluating the new guidance and therefore is unable to estimate the impact to its financial statements . the asu could result in a material adverse effect on our stockholders ' equity and results of operations , including our net income . financial and economic environment our business and results of operations are materially affected by conditions in the capital markets and the economy generally . stressed conditions , volatility and disruptions in the capital markets , particular markets , or financial asset classes can have an adverse effect on us . the impact on capital markets and the economy generally of the priorities and policies of the trump administration is uncertain . see “ risk factors — economic environment and capital markets-related risks — if difficult conditions in the capital markets and the u.s. economy generally persist or are perceived to persist , they may materially adversely affect our business and results of operations. ” equity market performance can affect our profitability for variable annuities and other separate account products as a result of the effects it has on product demand , revenues , expenses , reserves and our risk management effectiveness . the level of long-term interest rates and the shape of the yield curve can have a negative effect on the demand for , and the profitability of , spread-based products such as fixed annuities , index-linked annuities and universal life insurance . low interest rates and risk premium , including credit spread , affect new money rates on invested assets and the cost 88 of product guarantees . insurance premium growth and demand for our products is impacted by the general health of u.s. economic activity . the above factors affect our expectations regarding future margins , which in turn , affect the amortization of certain of our intangible assets such as dac and voba . significantly lower expected margins may cause us to accelerate the amortization of dac and voba , thereby reducing net income in the affected reporting period . we review our long-term assumptions about capital market returns and interest rates , along with other assumptions such as contract holder behavior , as part of our annual actuarial review . as additional company specific and or industry information on contract holder behavior becomes available , related assumptions may change and may potentially have a material impact on liability valuations and net income . in addition , the change in accounting estimate relating to the liability valuations that occurred in the second quarter of 2016 may result in greater income statement volatility in the future . demographics we believe that demographic trends in the u.s. population , the increase in under-insured individuals , the potential risk to governmental social safety net programs and the shifting of responsibility for retirement planning and financial security from employers and other institutions to individuals , highlight the need of individuals to plan for their long-term financial security and will create opportunities to generate significant demand for our products . by focusing our product development and marketing efforts to meeting the needs of certain targeted customer segments identified as part of our strategy , we will be able to focus on offering a smaller number of products that we believe are appropriately priced given current economic conditions , which we believe will benefit our expense ratio thereby increasing our profitability . competitive environment the life insurance industry remains highly fragmented and competitive . see “ business — segments and corporate & other ” for each of our segments . in particular , we believe that financial strength and financial flexibility are highly relevant differentiators from the perspective of customers and distributors . we believe we are adequately positioned to compete in this environment . regulatory developments our life insurance companies are regulated primarily at the state level , with some products and services also subject to federal regulation . in addition , brighthouse financial , inc. and its insurance subsidiaries are subject to regulation under the insurance holding company laws of various u.s. jurisdictions . furthermore , some of our operations , products and services are subject to erisa , consumer protection laws , securities , broker-dealer and investment advisor regulations , and environmental and unclaimed property laws and regulations . see “ business — regulation ” and “ risk factors — regulatory and legal risks. ” in addition , regulation 187 adopts a “ best interest ” standard for the sale of life insurance and annuity products in new york , which may have adverse effects on our business by imposing greater compliance , oversight , disclosure and notification requirements on us . the naic , other states and the sec are also considering or have proposed similar regulations . summary of critical accounting estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to adopt accounting policies and make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported on the consolidated and combined financial statements . the most critical estimates include those used in determining : i. liabilities for future policy benefits ; ii . accounting for reinsurance ; iii . capitalization and amortization of dac and the amortization of voba ; iv .

"income ( losses ) from equity investments accounted for under the equity method of accounting and fair value option for the years ended december story_separator_special_tag the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the other sections of this form 10-k , including the consolidated financial statements and related notes contained in item 8 , and the discussion of risk factors that may affect future results in item 1a . description of the company for a description of altria , see item 1. business , and background in note 1. executive summary in this management 's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations section , altria refers to the following “ adjusted ” financial measures : adjusted operating companies income ( loss ) ( “ oci ” ) ; adjusted oci margins ; adjusted net earnings attributable to altria ; adjusted diluted earnings ( losses ) per share ( “ eps ” ) attributable to altria ; and adjusted effective tax rates . these adjusted financial measures are not required by , or calculated in accordance with , united states generally accepted accounting principles ( “ gaap ” ) and may not be calculated the same as similarly titled measures used by other companies . these adjusted financial measures should thus be considered as supplemental in nature and not considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related financial information prepared in accordance with gaap . except as noted in 2021 forecasted results section below , when altria provides a non-gaap measure in this form 10-k , it also provides a reconciliation of that non-gaap financial measure to the most directly comparable gaap financial measure . for a further description of these non-gaap financial measures , see the non-gaap financial measures section below . covid-19 pandemic the covid-19 pandemic has led to adverse impacts on the u.s. and global economies and continues to create economic uncertainty . although much uncertainty still surrounds the pandemic , including its duration and ultimate overall impact on u.s. and global economies , its subsidiaries ' operations and those of altria 's investees , altria continues to monitor the macroeconomic risks of the covid-19 pandemic and continues to carefully evaluate potential outcomes and work to mitigate risks . specifically , altria remains focused on any potential impact to its liquidity , operations , supply and distribution chains and on economic conditions . in terms of altria 's liquidity , despite some volatility in the commercial paper market in march 2020 , altria was able to build and maintain a higher cash balance than normal to preserve its financial flexibility . as a precautionary measure , in march 2020 , altria borrowed the full $ 3.0 billion available under its senior unsecured 5-year revolving credit agreement ( as amended , the “ credit agreement ” ) , which altria subsequently repaid in full in june 2020. in may 2020 , altria issued $ 2.0 billion of long-term debt in the form of senior unsecured notes . in april 2020 , the board of directors rescinded the $ 500 million remaining in the previously authorized $ 1.0 billion share repurchase program . altria did not repurchase any shares under its share repurchase program in 2020. as with so many other companies throughout the u.s. and globally , altria 's operations have been affected by the covid-19 pandemic . altria has implemented remote working for many employees and aligned with the social distancing protocols recommended by public 17 table of contents health authorities . to date , altria believes its tobacco businesses have not experienced any material adverse effects associated with governmental actions to restrict consumer movement or business operations , but continues to monitor these factors . altria continues to believe that remote working due to the covid-19 pandemic has had minimal impact on productivity . also , altria 's critical information technology systems have remained operational . although altria 's tobacco businesses previously suspended operations temporarily at several of their manufacturing facilities in march 2020 , the businesses resumed operations at those facilities under enhanced safety protocols in april 2020 and all manufacturing facilities are currently operational under enhanced safety protocols . altria continues to monitor the risks associated with facility disruptions and workforce availability as a result of uncertainty related to the covid-19 pandemic . altria 's suppliers and those within its distribution chain are also subject to government actions that may require the closure of a facility and remote working protocols . to date , altria has not experienced any material disruptions to its supply chains or distribution systems , but is continuing to monitor these factors . the majority of retail stores in which altria 's tobacco products are sold , including convenience stores , have been deemed to be essential businesses by authorities and have remained open . altria continues to monitor the risk that one or more suppliers , distributors or any other entities within our

june 2020 , pm usa re-opened its atlanta and richmond iqos stores , and in july 2020 , pm usa launched iqos in charlotte , with all stores operating under enhanced safety protocols . in 2020 , altria incurred net pre-tax charges of $ 50 million , which were directly related to disruptions caused by or efforts to mitigate the impact of the covid-19 pandemic . these costs , which were recorded in the second quarter and excluded from altria 's adjusted results , included premium pay , personal protective equipment and health screenings , partially offset by certain employment tax credits . these net pre-tax charges do not include the inventory-related implementation costs associated with the wine business strategic reset . although altria 's tobacco businesses have not been materially impacted to date by the covid-19 pandemic , there is continued uncertainty as to how the covid-19 pandemic may impact adult tobacco consumers in the future . story_separator_special_tag 19 table of contents ▪ operations : the increase of $ 353 million in operations ( which excludes the impact of special items shown above ) was due primarily to the following : ▪ higher income from the smokeable products and oral tobacco products segments ; partially offset by : ▪ lower income from altria 's equity investments in abi and cronos ; ▪ higher losses in the all other category ( primarily driven by reductions in the estimated residual values of certain assets at pmcc in 2020 ) ; ▪ higher amortization expense ; ▪ higher interest and other debt expense , net ; and ▪ lower income from the wine segment . for further details , see the consolidated operating results and operating results by business segment sections below . 2021 forecasted results altria forecasts its 2021 full-year adjusted diluted eps to be in a range of $ 4.49 to $ 4.62 , representing a growth rate of 3 % to 6 % over its 2020 full-year adjusted diluted eps base of $ 4.36 , as shown in the table below . while the 2021 full-year adjusted diluted eps guidance accounts for a range of scenarios , the external environment remains dynamic . altria will continue to monitor conditions related to ( i ) unemployment rates , ( ii ) fiscal stimulus , ( iii ) adult tobacco consumer dynamics , including stay-at-home practices , disposable income , purchasing patterns and adoption of non-combustible products , ( iv ) regulatory and legislative ( including excise tax ) developments , ( v ) the timing and breadth of covid-19 vaccine deployment and ( vi ) expectations for adjusted earnings contributions from its alcohol assets . altria 's 2021 full-year adjusted diluted eps guidance range includes planned investments in support of its vision , such as ( i ) marketplace investments to expand the availability and awareness of altria 's non-combustible products , ( ii ) costs associated with building an industry-leading consumer engagement platform that enhances data collection and insights in support of adult tobacco consumer conversion to non-combustible products and ( iii ) increased non-combustible product research and development expense . altria expects 2021 adjusted diluted eps growth to come in the last three quarters of the year , primarily due to prior year comparisons , including one fewer shipping day for the smokeable products segment in the first quarter . this forecasted growth rate excludes estimated per share charges in the first quarter of 2021 of $ 0.27 for loss on early extinguishment of debt for the february 2021 tender offers and redemption . for further discussion , see financial review - debt and liquidity - debt below . altria expects its 2021 full-year adjusted effective tax rate will be in a range of 24.5 % to 25.5 % . replace_table_token_4_th for a discussion of certain income and expense items excluded from the forecasted results above , see the consolidated operating results section below . altria 's full-year adjusted diluted eps guidance and full-year forecast for its adjusted effective tax rate exclude the impact of certain income and expense items , including those items noted in the non-gaap financial measures section below , that management believes are not part of underlying operations . altria 's management can not estimate on a forward-looking basis the impact of these items on its reported diluted eps or its reported effective tax rate because these items , which could be significant , may be unusual or infrequent , are difficult to predict and may be highly variable . as a result , altria does not provide a corresponding gaap measure for , or reconciliation to , its adjusted diluted eps guidance or its adjusted effective tax rate forecast . 20 table of contents non-gaap financial measures while altria reports its financial results in accordance with gaap , its management also reviews certain financial results , including oci , oci margins , net earnings ( losses ) attributable to altria and diluted eps , on an adjusted basis , which excludes certain income and expense items that management believes are not part of underlying operations . these items may include , for example , loss on early extinguishment of debt , restructuring charges , asset impairment charges , acquisition-related costs , covid-19 special items , equity investment-related special items ( including any changes in fair value of the equity investment and any related warrants and preemptive rights ) , certain tax items , charges associated with tobacco and health litigation items , and resolutions of certain non-participating manufacturer ( “ npm ” ) adjustment disputes under the 1998 master settlement agreement ( such dispute resolutions are referred to as “ npm adjustment items ” ) . altria 's management does not view any of these special items to be part of altria 's underlying results as they may be highly variable , may be unusual or infrequent , are difficult to predict and can distort underlying business trends and results . altria 's management also reviews income tax rates on an adjusted basis . altria 's adjusted effective tax rate may exclude certain tax items from its reported effective tax rate . altria 's management believes that adjusted financial measures provide useful additional insight into underlying business trends and results , and provide a more meaningful comparison of year-over-year results . adjusted financial measures are used by management and regularly provided to altria 's chief operating decision maker ( “ codm ” ) for planning , forecasting and evaluating business and financial performance , including allocating resources and evaluating results relative to employee compensation targets . these adjusted financial measures are not required by , or calculated in accordance with gaap and may not be calculated the same as similarly titled measures used by other companies . these adjusted financial measures should thus be considered as supplemental in nature and not considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related financial information prepared in accordance with gaap .

telecommunications providers , and other construction and maintenance services to electric and gas utilities and others . for the fiscal year ended july 27 , 2013 , the percentage of our revenue by customer type from telecommunications , underground facility locating , and electric and gas utilities and other customers , was approximately 87.7 % , 7.9 % , and 4.4 % , respectively . we conduct operations through our subsidiaries . our revenues may fluctuate as a result of changes in the capital expenditure and maintenance budgets of our customers , changes in the general level of construction activity , as well as overall economic conditions . the capital expenditures and maintenance budgets of our telecommunications customers may be impacted by consumer and business demands on telecommunications providers , the introduction of new communication technologies , the physical maintenance needs of their infrastructure , the actions of our government and the federal communications commission , and general economic conditions . a significant portion of our services are performed under master service agreements and other arrangements with customers that extend for periods of one or more years . we are party to numerous master service agreements and generally maintain multiple agreements with each of our customers . master service agreements generally contain customer-specified service requirements , such as discrete pricing for individual tasks . to the extent that such contracts specify exclusivity , there are often a number of exceptions , including the ability of the customer to issue work orders valued above a specified dollar amount to other service providers , perform work with the customer 's own employees , and use other service providers when jointly placing facilities with another utility . in most cases , a customer may terminate an agreement for convenience with written notice . the remainder of our services are provided pursuant to contracts for specific projects . long-term contracts relate to specific projects with terms in excess of one year from the contract date . short-term contracts for specific projects are generally of three to four months in duration . a portion of our contracts include retainage provisions by which 5 % to 10 % of the contract invoicing may be withheld by the customer pending project completion . we recognize revenues under the percentage of completion method of accounting using the units-of-delivery or cost-to-cost measures . a majority of our contracts are based on units-of-delivery and revenue is recognized as each unit is completed . revenues from contracts using the cost-to-cost measures of completion are recognized based on the ratio of contract costs incurred to date to total estimated contract costs . revenues from services provided under time and materials based contracts are recognized as the services are performed . the following table summarizes our revenues from multi-year master service agreements and other long-term contracts , as a percentage of contract revenues : replace_table_token_5_th the percentage of revenue from long-term contracts varies from period to period depending on the mix of work performed under our contracts . during fiscal 2013 , a higher percentage of revenue was earned for services performed under short-term contracts as compared to the prior two fiscal years , primarily as a result of increased work performed for certain rural 19 broadband customers . additionally , during fiscal 2013 we performed increased work for storm restoration services pursuant to short-term contracts . a significant portion of our revenue is derived from several large customers . the following table reflects the percentage of total revenue from those customers who contributed at least 2.5 % of our total revenue in fiscal 2013 , 2012 , or 2011 : replace_table_token_6_th cost of earned revenues includes all direct costs of providing services under our contracts , including costs for direct labor provided by employees , services by independent subcontractors , operation of capital equipment ( excluding depreciation and

provide all required materials while we provide the necessary personnel , tools , and equipment . materials supplied by our customers , for which the customer retains financial and performance risk , are not included in our revenue or costs of sales . general and administrative expenses include costs of management personnel and administrative overhead at our subsidiaries , as well as our corporate costs . these costs primarily consist of employee compensation and related expenses , including stock-based compensation , legal , consulting and professional fees , information technology and development costs , provision for or recoveries of bad debt expense , and other costs that are not directly related to the performance of our services under customer contracts . in connection with the businesses acquired in fiscal 2013 , we recognized approximately $ 6.8 million and $ 3.4 million of pre-tax acquisition and integration costs , respectively , during fiscal 2013 which are included within general and administrative expenses . our senior management , including the senior managers of our subsidiaries , perform substantially all of our sales and marketing functions as part of their management responsibilities and , accordingly , we have not incurred material sales and marketing expenses . information technology and development costs included in general and administrative expenses are primarily incurred to support and to enhance our operating efficiency . to protect our rights , we have filed for patents on certain of our innovations . story_separator_special_tag in addition , it reinforces our rural engineering and construction capabilities , wireless construction resources , and broadband construction competencies . we expect the acquisition to enhance the efficiency of the company 's operating scale . during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013 , we acquired sage telecommunications corp of colorado , llc ( `` sage '' ) . sage provides telecommunications construction and project management services primarily for cable operators in the western united states . we recognized approximately $ 0.2 million in pre-tax acquisition costs related to sage . additionally , during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013 we acquired certain assets of a tower construction and maintenance company . the purchase prices of the businesses acquired have been allocated to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and the liabilities assumed on the basis of their fair values on the respective dates of acquisition . purchase price in excess of fair value of the separately identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed have been allocated to goodwill . purchase price 21 allocations are based on information regarding the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the dates of acquisition . we determined the fair values used in the purchase price allocation for intangible assets based on historical data , estimated discounted future cash flows , contract backlog amounts , if applicable , and expected royalty rates for trademarks and trade names among other information . for the acquired subsidiaries , the fair values used in the purchase price allocation for intangible assets were determined with the assistance of an independent valuation specialist . the valuation of assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires a number of judgments and is subject to revision as additional information about the fair value of assets and liabilities becomes available . the allocation of the purchase price of the acquired subsidiaries was completed during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013. purchase price allocations of businesses acquired during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013 are preliminary and will be completed during fiscal 2014 when the valuations for intangible assets and other amounts are finalized . additional information , which existed as of the date of acquisition but at that time was unknown , may become known to us during the remainder of the measurement period , a period not to exceed twelve months from the acquisition date . adjustments in the purchase price allocations may require a recasting of the amounts allocated to goodwill . outlook the telecommunications industry has undergone and continues to undergo significant changes due to advances in technology , increased competition as the telephone and cable companies have converged , growing consumer demand for enhanced and bundled services , and governmental broadband stimulus funding . as a result of these factors , the networks of our customers increasingly face demands for more capacity and greater reliability . telecommunications providers continue to outsource a significant portion of their engineering , construction and maintenance requirements in order to reduce their investment in capital equipment , provide flexibility in workforce sizing , expand product offerings without large increases in incremental hiring and focus on those competencies they consider core to their business success . these factors drive customer demand for the types of services we provide . telecommunications network operators are increasingly relying on the deployment of fiber optic cable technology deeper into their networks and closer to consumers and businesses in order to respond to demands for capacity , reliability , and product bundles of voice , video , and high speed data services . fiber deployments have enabled an increasing number of cable companies to offer voice services in addition to their traditional video and data services . these voice services require the installation of customer premise equipment and at times the upgrade of in-home wiring . additionally , fiber deployments are also facilitating the provisioning of video services by local telephone companies in addition to their traditional voice and high speed data services . several large telephone companies have pursued fiber-to-the-premise and fiber-to-the-node initiatives to compete actively with cable operators . these long-term initiatives and the possibility that other telephone companies may pursue similar strategies present opportunities for us . significant demand for mobile broadband is driven by the proliferation of smart phones and other wireless data devices . this demand and other advances in technology have created the need for wireless carriers to upgrade their networks . wireless carriers are actively spending on their networks to respond to the explosion in wireless data traffic , upgrade network technologies to improve performance and efficiency and consolidate disparate technology platforms . these customer initiatives present long-term opportunities for us with the wireless service providers we serve . further , the demand for mobile broadband has increased bandwidth requirements on the wired networks of our customers . as the demand for mobile broadband grows , the amount of wireless traffic that must be `` backhauled '' over customers ' fiber networks increases and , as a result , carriers are accelerating the deployment of fiber optic cables to cellular sites . these trends are also increasing the demand for the types of services we provide . cable companies are continuing to target the provision of data and voice services to residential customers and have expanded their service offerings to business customers . often times these services are provided over fiber optic cables using `` metro ethernet '' technology . the commercial geographies that cable companies are targeting for network deployments generally require incremental fiber optic cable deployment and , as a result , require the type of engineering and construction services that we provide . additionally , we provide underground facility locating services to a variety of utility companies , including telecommunication providers . underground facility locating is required prior to underground excavation and is impacted by overall economic activity .

ended december 31 , 2013 versus a provision for loan losses of $ 9,423,000 during the year ended december 31 , 2012. the decrease in the provision for loan losses for the year ended december 31 , 2013 as compared to the year ended december 31 , 2012 was primarily the result of improvement in collateral values and estimated cash flows related to nonperforming loans and purchased credit impaired

2014. service charges on deposit accounts were down $ 905,000 ( 7.1 % ) due to reduced customer overdrafts and a resulting decrease in non-sufficient funds fees . atm fees and interchange revenue increased $ 1,281,000 ( 15.3 % ) due to increased interchange revenue from the negotiation of a more favorable agreement with the company 's interchange service provider , increased sales efforts in this area , and the acquisition of north valley bancorp and its customer base . overall , mortgage banking activities , which includes mortgage banking servicing fees , change in value of mortgage servicing rights , and gain on sale of loans , accounted for $ 2,600,000 of noninterest income in the 2014 compared to $ 7,629,000 in 2013. this $ 5,029,000 ( 65.9 % ) decrease in mortgage banking related revenue was mainly due to an increase in mortgage rates that occurred in may 2013 that resulted in reduced mortgage refinance activity and reduced gain on sale of loans in the second half of 2013 and throughout 2014 , and a decrease in change in value of mortgage servicing rights as projected servicing fees were reduced due to reduced mortgage rates at the end of 2014 that are expected to result in increased refinance activity and shorter lives of existing servicing assets . increase in cash value of life insurance improved $ 226,000 ( 13.1 % ) during 2014 due to the addition of life insurance in the north valley bancorp acquisition . change in indemnification asset improved $ 793,000 to a negative contribution to revenue of $ 856,000 in 2014 is primarily due to a decrease in estimated loan losses from the loan portfolio and foreclosed assets acquired in the granite acquisition on may 28 , 2010 , and the fact that such losses are generally covered at the rate of 80 % by the fdic . the actual decrease in estimated losses is reflected in increased interest income , decreased provision for loan losses and or decreased provision for foreclosed asset losses . gain on sale of foreclosed assets increased $ 513,000 ( 31.3 % ) to $ 2,153,000 during 2014 primarily due to improved property values . noninterest income decreased $ 1,151,000 ( 3.0 % ) to $ 36,829,000 in 2013. service charges on deposit accounts were down $ 1,574,000 ( 11.0 % ) due to reduced customer overdrafts and a resulting decrease in non-sufficient funds fees . atm fees and 26 interchange income was

servicing rights , and gain on sale of loans , accounted for $ 7,629,000 of noninterest income in the 2013 compared to $ 6,460,000 in 2012. this $ 1,169,000 ( 18.1 % ) increase in mortgage banking related revenue is mainly due to historically low mortgage rates and the associated high level of mortgage refinance activity that existed during most of 2013 , the bank 's focus of resources in this area , and an increase in mortgage rates in the second half of 2013 that while significantly decreasing originations , sales , and gain on sale of loans during the second half of 2013 , also resulted in an increase in the value of the company 's mortgage servicing rights during 2013. commissions on sale of nondeposit investment products decreased $ 226,000 ( 7.0 % ) in 2013. the change in

through retrospective application of the new policy to all periods presented . these changes did not have an impact to any period presented on the consolidated statements of income . refer to note 1 , `` summary of significant accounting policies , '' of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information regarding this accounting policy change . subsequent event on july 24 ,

united kingdom would not be realized , and was more likely than not that certain deferred tax assets of poland and germany would be realized . the impact of the net valuation allowance provision offset the benefit of valuation allowance releases and , as such , there was no net impact to income tax expense in the three month period or year ended september 30 , 2015. uncertain tax positions the company is subject to income taxes in the u.s. and numerous foreign jurisdictions . judgment is required in determining its worldwide provision for income taxes and recording the related assets and liabilities . in the ordinary course of the company 's business , there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain . the company is regularly under audit by tax authorities . during fiscal 2015 , the company settled a significant number of tax examinations in germany , mexico and the u.s. , impacting fiscal years 1998 to fiscal 2012. the settlement of unrecognized tax benefits included cash payments for approximately $ 440 million and the loss of various tax attributes . the reduction for tax positions of prior years is substantially related to foreign exchange rates . in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 , income tax audit resolutions resulted in a net $ 99 million benefit to income tax expense . the company 's federal income tax returns and certain non-u.s. income tax returns for various fiscal years remain under various stages of audit by the internal revenue service ( `` irs '' ) and respective non-u.s. tax authorities .

amounts sufficient to pay assessments , if any , which may be proposed by the taxing authorities . at september 30 , 2016 , the company had recorded a liability for its best estimate of the probable loss on certain of its tax positions , the majority of which is included in other noncurrent liabilities in the consolidated statements of financial position . nonetheless , the amounts ultimately

company incurred significant charges for restructuring and impairment costs . refer to note 16 , `` significant restructuring and impairment costs , '' of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information . a substantial portion of these charges can not be benefited for tax purposes due to the company 's current tax position in these jurisdictions and the

the company completed its merger with tyco . as a result of that transaction , the company incurred incremental tax expense of $ 137 million . story_separator_special_tag the increase in volumes was

"the company determined that since the powers to direct the activities most significant to the economic performance of these entities are shared equally by the company and its joint venture partners story_separator_special_tag the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this report . we make statements in this section that are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws . for a complete discussion of forward- looking statements , see the section in this form 10-k entitled `` statements regarding forward-looking information . '' certain risk factors may cause actual results , performance or achievements to differ materially from those expressed or implied by the following discussion . for a discussion of such risk factors , see the section in this form 10-k entitled `` risk factors . '' ( amounts in thousands , except share and per share data . ) overview we are a fully integrated , self-administered and self-managed real estate investment trust , or reit , formed to continue the business commenced in 1977 by our predecessor companies to own , operate , manage , acquire , develop and redevelop professionally managed self-storage properties . since our ipo , our fully integrated development and acquisition teams have completed the development or acquisition of 595 self-storage properties . at december 31 , 2011 , we owned , had ownership interests in , or managed 882 operating properties in 34 states and washington , d.c. of these 882 operating properties , 356 were wholly-owned , we held joint venture interests in 341 properties , and our taxable reit subsidiary , extra space management , inc. , operated an additional 185 properties that are owned by franchisees or third parties in exchange for a management fee . these operating properties contain approximately 64 million square feet of rentable space in approximately 585,000 units and currently serve a customer base of over 448,000 tenants . our properties are generally situated in convenient , highly visible locations clustered around large population centers such as atlanta , baltimore/washington , d.c. , boston , chicago , dallas , houston , las vegas , los angeles , miami , new york city , orlando , philadelphia , phoenix , st. petersburg/tampa and san francisco/oakland . these areas all enjoy above average population growth and income levels . the clustering of our assets around these population centers enables us to reduce our operating costs through economies of scale . we consider a property to be in the lease-up stage after it has been issued a certificate of occupancy , but before it has achieved stabilization . a property is considered to be stabilized once it has achieved an 80 % occupancy rate for a full year measured as of january 1 , or has been open for three years . to maximize the performance of our properties , we employ a state-of-the-art , web-based tracking and yield management technology called store . developed by our management team , store enables us to analyze , set and adjust rental rates in real time across our portfolio in order to respond to changing market conditions . in addition , we also have an industry-leading revenue management system . we believe that the combination of store 's yield management capabilities and the systematic processes developed by our team using our revenue management system allows us to more proactively manage revenues . we derive substantially all of our revenues from rents received from tenants under existing leases at each of our self-storage properties , from management fees on the properties we manage for joint-venture partners , franchisees and unaffiliated third parties and from our tenant reinsurance program . our management fee is generally equal to approximately 6 % of cash collected from total revenues generated by the managed properties . we also receive an asset management fee of 0.5 % of the total asset value from one of our joint ventures . we operate in competitive markets , often where consumers have multiple self-storage properties from which to choose . competition has impacted , and will continue to impact our property results . we experience seasonal fluctuations in occupancy levels , with occupancy levels generally higher in the 27 summer months due to increased moving activity . our operating results depend materially on our ability to lease available self-storage units , to actively manage unit rental rates , and on the ability of our tenants to make required rental payments . we believe that we are able to respond quickly and effectively to changes in local , regional and national economic conditions by adjusting rental rates through the use of store , and through the use of our revenue management system . we continue to evaluate and implement a range of new initiatives and opportunities in order to enable us to maximize stockholder value . our strategies to maximize stockholder value include the following : maximize the performance of properties through strategic , efficient and proactive management . we pursue revenue-generating and expense minimizing opportunities in our operations . our revenue management team seeks to maximize revenue by responding to changing market conditions through our technology system 's ability to provide real-time , interactive rental rate and discount management . our size allows us greater ability than most of our competitors to implement national , regional and local marketing programs , which we believe attract more customers to our stores at a lower net cost . acquire self-storage properties from strategic partners and third parties . our acquisitions team continues to pursue the acquisition of single properties and multi-property portfolios that we believe can provide stockholder value . we have established a reputation as a reliable , ethical buyer , which we believe enhances our ability to negotiate and close acquisitions . in addition , we believe our status as an upreit enables flexibility when structuring deals . expand our management business . our management business enables us to generate increased revenues through management fees and expand our geographic footprint . story_separator_special_tag the value associated with these assumed leases were recorded as intangibles , which will be amortized over the lease terms . evaluation of asset impairment : we evaluate long lived assets held for use when events or circumstances indicate that there may be impairment . we review each property at least annually to determine if any such events or circumstances have occurred or exist . we focus on properties where occupancy and or rental income have decreased by a significant amount . for these properties , we determine whether the decrease is temporary or permanent and whether the property will likely recover the lost occupancy and or revenue in the short term . in addition , we carefully review properties in the lease-up stage and compare actual operating results to original projections . 29 when we determine that an event that may indicate impairment has occurred , we compare the carrying value of the related long-lived assets to the undiscounted future net operating cash flows attributable to the assets . an impairment loss is recorded if the net carrying value of the assets exceeds the undiscounted future net operating cash flows attributable to the assets . the impairment loss recognized equals the excess of net carrying value over the related fair value of the assets . when real estate assets are identified as held for sale , we discontinue depreciating the assets and estimate the fair value of the assets , net of selling costs . if the estimated fair values , net of selling costs , of the assets that have been identified for sale are less than the net carrying value of the assets , a valuation allowance is established . the operations of assets held for sale or sold during the period are generally presented as discontinued operations for all periods presented . fair value of financial instruments : the carrying values of cash and cash equivalents , restricted cash , receivables , other financial instruments included in other assets , accounts payable and accrued expenses , variable rate notes payable , lines of credit and other liabilities reflected in the consolidated balance sheets at december 31 , 2011 and 2010 , approximate fair value . the fair values of our notes receivable , our fixed rate notes payable and notes payable to trusts and exchangeable senior notes are as follows : replace_table_token_7_th investments in real estate ventures : our investments in real estate joint ventures where we have significant influence but not control , and joint ventures which are vies in which we are not the primary beneficiary , are recorded under the equity method of accounting on the accompanying consolidated financial statements . under the equity method , our investment in real estate ventures is stated at cost and adjusted for our share of net earnings or losses and reduced by distributions . equity in earnings of real estate ventures is generally recognized based on our ownership interest in the earnings of each of the unconsolidated real estate ventures . for the purposes of presentation in the statement of cash flows , we follow the `` look through '' approach for classification of distributions from joint ventures . under this approach , distributions are reported under operating cash flow unless the facts and circumstances of a specific distribution clearly indicate that it is a return of capital ( e.g. , a liquidating dividend or distribution of the proceeds from the joint venture 's sale of assets ) in which case it is reported as an investing activity . our management assesses annually whether there are any indicators that the value of our investments in unconsolidated real estate ventures may be impaired and when events or circumstances indicate that there may be impairment . an investment is impaired if management 's estimate of the fair value of the investment , using significant unobservable inputs , is less than its carrying value . to the extent impairment has occurred and is considered to be other than temporary , the loss is measured as the excess of the carrying amount of the investment over the fair value of the investment . derivative instruments and hedging activities : the accounting for changes in the fair value of derivatives depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation . derivatives used to hedge the exposure to changes in the fair value of an asset , liability or firm commitment attributable to a particular risk , are considered fair value hedges . derivatives used to 30 hedge the exposure to variability in expected future cash flows , or other types of forecasted transactions , are considered cash flow hedges . for derivatives designated as fair value hedges , changes in the fair value of the derivative and the hedged item related to the hedged risk are recognized in earnings . for derivatives designated as cash flow hedges , the effective portion of changes in the fair value of the derivative is initially reported in other comprehensive income , outside of earnings and subsequently reclassified to earnings when the hedged transaction affects earnings . conversion of operating partnership units : conversions of operating partnership units to common stock , when converted under the original provisions of the operating partnership agreement , are accounted for by reclassifying the underlying net book value of the units from noncontrolling interest to our equity . the difference between the fair value of the consideration paid and the adjustment to the carrying amount of the noncontrolling interest is recognized as additional paid in capital of the company . revenue and expense recognition : rental revenues are recognized as earned based upon amounts that are currently due from tenants . leases are generally on month-to-month terms . prepaid rents are recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the leases . promotional discounts are recognized as a reduction to rental income over the promotional period . late charges , administrative fees , merchandise sales and truck rentals are recognized in income when earned .

tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an entity 's financial statements or tax returns . judgment is required in addressing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our consolidated financial statements or tax returns ( e.g. , realization of deferred tax assets , changes in tax laws or interpretations thereof ) . the company is subject to regular examination of its income tax returns by the u.s. federal , state and foreign tax authorities . a change in the assessment of the outcomes of such matters could materially impact our consolidated financial statements . as of june 30 , 2015 , we had estimated foreign net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $ 14.1 million , of which $ 0.5 million expires in 2017 through 2027 , and $ 13.6 million which has an indefinite utilization period . in addition , the company has estimated u.s. federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $ 37.4 million , which expire in 2015 through 2030 . valuation allowances are recognized to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that the company will not be able to utilize the deferred tax assets attributable to net operating and capital loss carryforwards of certain subsidiaries to offset future taxable earnings . the company has recorded valuation allowances of $ 9.2 million and $ 10.9 million at june 30 , 2015 and 2014 , respectively . the determination as to whether a deferred tax asset will be recognized is made on a jurisdictional basis and is based on the evaluation of historical taxable income or loss , projected future taxable income , carryforward periods , scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities and tax planning strategies . projected future taxable income is based on expected results and assumptions as to the jurisdiction in which the income will be earned . the assumptions used to project future taxable income requires significant judgment and are consistent with the plans and estimates used to manage the underlying businesses . share-based payments . asc no . 718 “ compensation—stock compensation ” requires the measurement of stock-based compensation expense based on the fair value of the award on the date of grant . we determine the fair value of stock options issued by using a binomial option-pricing model . the binomial option-pricing model considers a range of assumptions related to volatility , dividend yield , risk-free interest rate and employee exercise behavior . expected volatilities utilized in the binomial option-pricing model are based on a combination of implied market volatilities , historical volatility of our stock price and other factors . similarly , the dividend yield is based on historical experience and expected future changes . the risk-free rate is derived from the u.s. treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant . the binomial option-pricing model also incorporates exercise and forfeiture assumptions based on an analysis of historical data . the expected life of the stock option grants is derived from the output of the binomial model and represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding . determining these assumptions are subjective and complex , and therefore , a change in the assumptions utilized could impact the calculation of the fair value of our stock options . a hypothetical change of five percentage points applied to the volatility assumption used to determine the fair value of the fiscal year 2015 stock option grants would result in approximately a $ 2.3 million change in total pre-tax stock-based compensation expense for the fiscal year 2015 grants , which would be amortized over the vesting period . a hypothetical change of one year in the expected life assumption used to determine the fair value of the fiscal year 2015 stock option grants would result in approximately a $ 0.5 million change in the total pre-tax stock-based compensation expense for the fiscal year 2015 grants , which would be amortized over the vesting period . a hypothetical change of one percentage point in the forfeiture rate assumption used for the fiscal year 2015 stock option grants would result in approximately a $ 0.1 million change in the total pre-tax stock-based compensation expense for the fiscal year 2015 grants , which would be amortized over the vesting period . a hypothetical one-half percentage point change in the dividend yield assumption used to determine the fair value of the fiscal year 2015 stock option grants would result in approximately a $ 1.0 million change in the total pre-tax stock-based compensation expense for the fiscal year 2015 grants , which would be amortized over the vesting period . 26 ibm information technology services agreements in march 2010 , the company and international business machines corporation ( “ ibm ” ) entered into an information technology services agreement ( the “ it services agreement ” ) , under which ibm provides certain aspects of the company 's information technology infrastructure . under the it services agreement , ibm provides a broad range of technology services to the company including supporting its mainframe , midrange , open systems , network and data center operations , as well as providing disaster recovery services . the company has the option of incorporating additional services into the agreement over time . the migration of data center processing to ibm was completed in august 2012. the it services agreement

activities after changes in working capital items was $ 3,871,000 , primarily due to net income adjusted for depreciation and higher current liabilities partially offset by higher accounts receivable and inventories . in fiscal 2007 , cash flow from discontinued operating activities after changes in working capital items was $ 795,000. in fiscal 2007 , the company used $ 837,000 for capital expenditures relating to continuing operations for new and replacement equipment and $ 112,000 for capital expenditures relating to discontinued operations . off-balance sheet arrangements the company has no off-balance sheet financing arrangements . contractual obligations the company had no long-term borrowings , capital leases , purchase obligations or other long-term liabilities at june 30 , 2008 or 2007. the company has an unsecured $ 4,000,000 revolving credit facility with a bank ( see note 15 to consolidated financial statements for further information regarding this facility ) .

net income for the year ended june 30 , 2007 of $ 10,607,000 compared to net income of $ 4,845,000 for the year ended june 30 , 2006 . 17 critical accounting policies the methods , estimates and judgments the company uses in applying the accounting policies most critical to its financial statements have a significant impact on the results the company reports in its financial statements . the securities and exchange commission has defined the most critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of the company 's financial condition and results , and requires the company to make its most difficult and subjective judgments . based on this definition , the company 's most critical accounting policies include : revenue recognition , recording of inventory reserves , deferred taxes , and the potential impairment of goodwill . these policies are discussed below . the company also has other key accounting policies , including the establishment of bad debt reserves . the company believes that these other policies either do not generally require it to make estimates and judgments that are as difficult or as subjective , or are less likely to have a material impact on the company 's reported results of operations for a given period . although the company believes that its estimates and assumptions are reasonable , they are based upon information available at the end of each reporting period and involve inherent risks and uncertainties . actual results may differ significantly from the company 's estimates and its estimates could be different using different assumptions or conditions . see note 1 to consolidated financial statements for additional information concerning significant accounting policies . revenue recognition the company recognizes sales revenue when it is realized and earned . the company 's reported sales revenue is based on meeting the following criteria : ( 1 ) manufacturing products based on customer specifications ; ( 2 ) delivering product to the customer before the close of the reporting period , whereby delivery results in the transfer of ownership risk to the customer ; ( 3 ) establishing a set sales price with the customer ; ( 4 ) collecting the sales revenue from the customer is reasonably assured ; and ( 5 ) no contingencies exist . inventory reserves a significant source of the company 's revenue arises from the sale of replacement parts required by customers who have previously purchased products . as a result , the company maintains a large quantity of parts on hand that may not be sold or used in final assemblies for an extended period of time . in order to recognize that certain inventory may become obsolete or that the company may have supplies in excess of reasonably supportable sales forecasts , an inventory valuation reserve has been established . the inventory valuation reserve is a significant estimate made by management . actual results may differ from this estimate , and the difference could be material . management establishes the inventory valuation reserve by reviewing the inventory for items that should be reserved in full based on a lack of usage for a specified period of time and for which future demand is not forecasted and establishes an additional reserve for slow moving inventory based on varying percentages of the cost of the items . the reserve for inventory valuation at june 30 , 2008 and 2007 was $ 406,000 and $ 524,000 , respectively .
","results of operations year ended june 30 , 2008 compared to year ended june 30 , 2007 consolidated sales for the year ended june 30 , 2008 totaled $ 61,635,000 , an increase of $ 14,706,000 or 31 % from fiscal year 2007 primarily due to higher volume of sales of complete energy source systems , air gun replacement parts , underwater electrical connectors and cables , and effective july 1 , 2007 , sales of air gun controllers/synchronizers , data loggers and auxiliary equipment . higher sales reflected continued strength in marine seismic activity and the acquired rts business , which contributed sales of $ 5,465,000. consolidated gross profit as a percentage of consolidated sales was 46 % for the year ended june 30 , 2008 , unchanged from the year ended june 30 , 2007. the gross profit in fiscal 2008 was positively impacted by higher gross profit associated with the acquired rts business , partially offset by lower gross profit associated with certain foreign sales , which included sales of auxiliary equipment purchased from outside vendors that normally have a lower margin than the company 's proprietary products . research and development costs for the year ended june 30 , 2008 increased by $ 2,000 or 1 % from the year ended june 30 , 2007. these expenditures were associated with work being done to improve the company 's annular port air guns ( apg guns ) and seismic source monitoring system ( ssms ) . selling , general and administrative ( sg & a ) expenses increased by $ 1,462,000 in fiscal year 2008 from fiscal year 2007 due primarily to the sg & a expenses of rts ( $ 661,000 ) , additional personnel and salary increases ( $ 341,000 ) , bad debt expense ( $ 201,000 ) , stock based compensation expense ( $ 158,000 ) and shareholder relations expenses ( $ 80,000 ) , partially offset by lower professional fees ( $ 285,000 ) due primarily to lower sarbanes-oxley compliance costs .

"during the year ended december 31 , 2012 , interest expense decreased $ 21.4 million , or 1.0 % , from 2011 primarily due to a change in our interest rate swap agreements in 2011 offset by higher interest rates and debit balances . interest expense for 2012 included ( i ) $ 140.0 million of expenses related to derivatives not designated as accounting hedges and ( ii ) $ 28.4 million of expense due to amortization and reclassification of deferred losses on derivative instruments from accumulated other comprehensive loss ( `` aocl '' ) . interest expense for 2011 included a $ 183.2 million charge as a result of our determination that our interest rate swap agreements no longer qualified as hedging instruments for accounting purposes . see note 9 , `` debt , '' for additional discussion of interest expense . gain/ ( loss ) on early extinguishment of debt during the year ended december 31 , 2013 , we recognized a loss on early extinguishment of debt of $ 29.8 million , primarily related to the cerp refinancing and additional charges from the repurchase of debt under the ceoc credit facility in the first and third quarters of 2013 , partially offset by third quarter gains on extinguishment of debt related to purchases of cmbs loans . during the year ended december 31 , 2012 , we recognized a net gain on early extinguishment of debt of $ 136.0 million , primarily due to the purchase of $ 367.3 million face value of cmbs debt for $ 229.3 million . this is compared with a gain of $ 47.9 million recognized in 2011. see note 9 , `` debt , '' for additional discussion of extinguishment of debt . gain on partial sale of subsidiary in connection with the sale of 45 % of our interest in the conrad , we recognized a gain of $ 44.1 million in the second quarter 2013. there was no comparable amount in the prior year . 43 income tax benefit the effective tax rate benefit for 2013 , 2012 and 2011 , was 34.7 % , 38.5 % and 42.2 % , respectively . the 2013 effective rate benefit was primarily impacted by the tax benefits from a capital loss resulting from a tax election made for u.s. federal income tax purposes and the reversal of uncertain tax positions offset by the change in our federal valuation allowance and the deferred tax implications of the cgp llc transaction in 2013. the 2012 effective tax rate benefit was primarily impacted by the tax benefit from the reversal of uncertain tax positions offset by the tax effects of nondeductible goodwill impairments . should the company continue to experience operating losses of the same magnitude it has experienced in the past several years , it is reasonably possible in the near term that the future reversal of its u.s. federal deductible temporary differences could exceed the future reversal of its u.s. federal taxable temporary differences , in which case the company would record a valuation allowance for such excess with a corresponding reduction of federal income tax benefit on its consolidated statements of operations . the year-over-year decrease in the effective tax rate benefit for 2012 was , primarily due to ( i ) nondeductible goodwill impairments in 2012 , ( ii ) a decrease in the tax benefit from foreign operations in 2012 mostly related to the effect of providing deferred taxes on unremitted earnings from foreign subsidiaries in uruguay that are no longer permanently reinvested , ( iii ) a decrease in state deferred tax benefits recognized in 2012 relative to 2011 mostly as a result of a state restructuring completed in 2011 , and ( iv ) deferred tax benefits recognized in 2011 from a correction of the deferred tax liabilities , which were partially offset by tax benefits recognized in 2012 from the decrease of uncertain tax positions relating to the settlement of a foreign matter and our irs examinations . see note 15 , `` income taxes , '' for additional information . income/ ( loss ) from discontinued operations , net of income taxes during the year ended december 31 , 2013 , loss from discontinued operations , net of income taxes was $ 30.0 million , primarily comprised of charges totaling $ 21.5 million for exit activities and the write-down of intangible and tangible assets related to the march 4 , 2013 closure of the alea leeds casino and net write-downs of $ 5.8 million related to our land concession in macau . during the year ended december 31 , 2012 , loss from discontinued operations , net of income taxes was $ 114.6 million and included a $ 101.0 million tangible asset impairment charge related to our land concession in macau . during the year ended december 31 , 2011 , income from discontinued operations , net of income taxes was $ 27.3 million and included $ 63.9 million of income taxes related to the sale of the harrah 's st. louis casino . liquidity and capital resources liquidity discussion and analysis we are a highly leveraged company and a significant amount of our liquidity needs are for debt service , including significant interest payments . as of december 31 , 2013 , we had $ 23,589.3 million face value of outstanding indebtedness and our current debt service obligation for 2014 is $ 2,383.0 million , consisting of $ 197.1 million in principal maturities and $ 2,185.9 million in required interest payments . our debt service obligation for 2015 is $ 3,223.7 million , consisting of $ 1,212.2 million in principal maturities and $ 2,011.5 million in required interest payments . the following table summarizes the annual maturities of the face value of our long-term debt as of december 31 , 2013 : replace_table_token_10_th _ ( 1 ) substantially all of these amounts are held by cgp llc . see note 9 , `` debt , '' for details on our debt outstanding and restrictive covenants related to certain of our borrowings . story_separator_special_tag our ability to refinance or restructure our debt , or to issue additional debt or equity , will depend upon , among other things : the condition of the capital markets at the time , which is beyond our control , our future financial and operating performance , which will be affected by prevailing economic conditions and financial , business , regulatory and other factors , many of which are beyond our control ; and our continued compliance with the terms and covenants in our credit facilities , indentures and loan agreements that govern our debt . under ceoc 's credit facilities , we are required to satisfy and maintain specified financial ratios . specifically , our credit facilities require ceoc to maintain an sslr of no more than 4.75 to 1.0 , which is the ratio of its senior first priority secured debt to ltm adjusted ebitda - pro forma - ceoc restricted . this ratio excludes up to $ 3,700.0 million of first priority senior secured notes and up to $ 350.0 million aggregate principal amount of consolidated debt of subsidiaries that are not wholly-owned . this ratio also reduces the amount of senior first priority secured debt by the amount of unrestricted ceoc cash on hand which was $ 1,450.2 million as of december 31 , 2013. as of december 31 , 2013 , the sslr was 4.52 to 1.0. while we were in compliance with the terms and conditions of all of our loan agreements , including ceoc 's credit facilities and indentures , as of december 31 , 2013 , in order to comply with the quarterly sslr covenant under the ceoc credit facility in the future , we will need to achieve a certain amount of ltm adjusted ebitda - pro-forma - ceoc restricted and or reduced levels of total ceoc senior secured net debt ( total senior secured debt less unrestricted cash ) . the factors that could impact the foregoing include ( a ) changes in gaming trips , spend per trip and hotel metrics , which we believe are correlated to consumer spending and confidence generally and spending by consumers for gaming and other entertainment activities , ( b ) our ability to effect cost savings initiatives , ( c ) our ability to complete asset sales , including the transaction described more fully in note 24 , ( d ) issuing additional second lien or unsecured debt , or project financing , ( e ) reducing net debt through open market purchases , privately negotiated transactions , redemptions , tender offers or exchanges , ( f ) equity issuances , ( g ) reductions in capital expenditures spending , or ( h ) a combination thereof . in addition , under certain circumstances , ceoc 's credit facilities allow us to apply cash contributions received by ceoc from cec as an increase to ltm adjusted ebitda - pro forma - ceoc restricted , if ceoc is unable to meet its sslr covenant , in order to cure any breach . based upon our current operating forecast , the expected closing of the ceoc asset sale to cgp llc described above , and our ability to achieve one or more of the other factors noted above , including our ability to cure a breach of the ceoc sslr , in certain circumstances , with cash contributions from cec , we believe that we will have sufficient liquidity to fund our operations and meet our debt service obligations and that we will continue to be in compliance with the ceoc sslr covenant during the next twelve months . effective february 8 , 2012 , as the result of our initial public offering , our common stock trades on the nasdaq global select market under the symbol `` czr . '' the net proceeds from our initial public offering were approximately $ 15 million , taking into account expenses and underwriting commissions , and giving effect to the exercise of the underwriters ' over-allotment option . in connection with the public offering , we effected a 1.742-for-1 split of our common stock . in march 2012 , we filed a prospectus with the sec , as part of a registration statement , to sell shares of our common stock , up to a maximum aggregate offering price of $ 500.0 million , and , in april 2012 , we entered into an equity distribution agreement whereby we may issue and sell up to 10.0 million shares of our common stock from time to time . on september 25 , 2013 , caesars entered into an underwriting agreement for the sale of 10.0 million shares of its common stock , par value $ 0.01 per share . the underwriter agreed to purchase the common stock from caesars at a price of $ 19.40 per share , which resulted in $ 194.0 million of proceeds to caesars before expenses . on september 27 , 2013 , the underwriter exercised its option to purchase 340,418 additional shares of common stock , resulting in approximately $ 6.6 million of additional proceeds to caesars before expenses . these transactions closed on october 1 , 2013 , and resulted in $ 200.6 million of cash proceeds to caesars before expenses . 46 ceoc financing , debt covenant compliance and restrictions ceoc credit facilities as of december 31 , 2013 , ceoc 's credit facilities provide for senior secured financing of up to $ 4,628.1 million , consisting of ( i ) senior secured term loan facilities in an aggregate principal amount of $ 4,412.6 million with $ 29.0 million maturing on january 28 , 2015 , $ 959.8 million maturing on october 31 , 2016 ( the `` incremental loans '' ) , and $ 3,423.8 million maturing on january 28 , 2018 , and ( ii ) a senior secured revolving credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of up to $ 215.5 million , with $ 109.4 million maturing january 28 , 2014 , and $ 106.1 million maturing january 28 , 2017 , including both a letter of credit sub-facility and

"the impairment analysis is based on predominant risk characteristics of the loans serviced , such as type , fixed and adjustable rate loans , original terms and interest rates . the amount of impairment recognized is the amount by which the mortgage loan servicing assets exceed their fair value . servicing fee income net of amortization and other loan fees collected on loans serviced for others are included in fees and service charges , net of amortization on the consolidated financial statements . derivative instruments —derivative instruments are carried at fair value in the company 's financial statements . for derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as cash flow story_separator_special_tag overview our business strategy is to operate as a well-capitalized and profitable financial institution dedicated to providing exceptional personal service to our customers . since being organized in 1938 , we grew to become , at the time of our initial public offering of stock in april 2007 , the nation 's largest mutually-owned savings and loan association based on total assets . we credit our success to our continued emphasis on our primary values : “ love , trust , respect , and a commitment to excellence , along with having fun. ” our values are reflected in the design and pricing of our loan and deposit products , and historically , in our home today program , as described below . our values are further reflected in the broadway redevelopment initiative ( a long-term revitalization program encompassing the three-mile corridor of the broadway-slavic village neighborhood in cleveland , ohio where our main office was established and continues to be located ) and the educational programs we have established and or supported . we intend to continue to adhere to our primary values and to support our customers and the communities in which we operate . management believes that the following matters are those most critical to our success : ( 1 ) controlling our interest rate risk exposure ; ( 2 ) monitoring and limiting our credit risk ; ( 3 ) maintaining access to adequate liquidity and diverse funding sources ; and ( 4 ) monitoring and controlling operating expenses . controlling our interest rate risk exposure . although the significant housing and credit quality issues that arose in connection with the 2008 financial crisis had a distinctly negative effect on our operating results and , as described below , that experience made a lasting impression on our risk awareness , historically our greatest risk has been our exposure to changes in interest rates . when we hold long-term , fixed-rate assets , funded by liabilities with shorter re-pricing characteristics , we are exposed to potentially adverse impacts from changing interest rates , and most notably rising interest rates . generally , and particularly over extended periods of time that encompass full economic cycles , interest rates associated with longer-term assets , like fixed-rate mortgages , have been higher than interest rates associated with shorter-term funding sources , like deposits . this difference has been an important component of our net interest income and is fundamental to our operations . we manage the risk of holding longer-term , fixed-rate mortgage assets primarily by maintaining the levels of regulatory capital required to be well capitalized , by promoting adjustable-rate loans and shorter-term , fixed-rate loans , and by opportunistically extending the duration of our funding sources . levels of regulatory capital at september 30 , 2016 , the company 's tier 1 ( leverage ) capital totaled $ 1.66 billion , or 13.07 % of net average assets and 23.74 % of risk-weighted assets , while the association 's tier 1 ( leverage ) capital totaled $ 1.49 billion , or 11.73 % of net average assets and 21.36 % of risk-weighted assets . each of these measures was more than twice the requirements currently in effect for the association for designation as “ well capitalized ” under regulatory prompt corrective action provisions , which set minimum levels of 5.00 % of net average assets and 8.00 % of risk-weighted assets . refer to the liquidity and capital resources of this item 7 for additional discussion regarding regulatory capital requirements . promotion of adjustable-rate loans and shorter-term , fixed-rate loans in july 2010 , we began marketing an adjustable-rate mortgage loan that provides us with improved interest rate risk characteristics when compared to a 30-year , fixed-rate mortgage loan . our “ smart rate ” adjustable rate mortgage offers borrowers an interest rate lower than that of a 30-year , fixed-rate loan . the interest rate in the smart rate mortgage is locked for three or five years then resets annually . the smart rate mortgage contains a feature to re-lock the rate an unlimited number of times at our then current interest rate and fee schedule , for another three or five years ( which must be the same as the original lock period ) without having to complete a full refinance transaction . re-lock eligibility is subject to a satisfactory payment performance history by the borrower ( current at the time of re-lock , and no foreclosures or bankruptcies since the smart rate application was taken ) . in addition to a satisfactory payment history , re-lock eligibility requires that the property continues to be the borrower 's primary residence . the loan term can not be extended in connection with a re-lock nor can new funds be advanced . all interest rate caps and floors remain as originated . beginning in the latter portion of fiscal 2012 , we began to feature a ten-year , fully amortizing fixed-rate first mortgage loan in our product promotions . the ten-year , fixed-rate loan has a less severe interest rate risk profile when compared to loans with fixed-rate terms of 15 to 30 years and helps us to more effectively manage our interest rate risk exposure , yet provides our borrowers with the certainty of a fixed interest rate throughout the life of the obligation . story_separator_special_tag at september 30 , 2016 , 91 % of our assets consisted of residential real estate loans ( both “ held for sale ” and “ held for investment ” ) and home equity loans and lines of credit , which were originated predominantly to borrowers in ohio and florida . our analytic procedures and evaluations include specific reviews of all home equity loans and lines of credit that become 90 or more days past due , as well as specific reviews of all first mortgage loans that become 180 or more days past due . we transfer performing home equity lines of credit subordinate to first mortgages delinquent greater than 90 days to non-accrual status . we also charge-off performing loans to collateral value and classify those loans as non-accrual within 60 days of notification of all borrowers filing chapter 7 bankruptcy , that have not reaffirmed or been dismissed , regardless of how long the loans have been performing . loans where at least one borrower has been discharged of their obligation in chapter 7 bankruptcy , are classified as tdrs . at september 30 , 2016 , $ 41.1 million of loans in chapter 7 bankruptcy status were included in total tdrs . at september 30 , 2016 , the recorded investment in non-accrual status loans included $ 40.5 million of performing loans in chapter 7 bankruptcy status , of which $ 38.5 million were also reported as tdrs . in response to the unfavorable regional and macro-economic environment that arose beginning in 2008 , and in an effort to limit our credit risk exposure and improve the credit performance of new customers , we tightened our credit eligibility criteria in evaluating a borrower 's ability to successfully fulfill his or her repayment obligation and we revised the design of many of our loan products to require higher borrower down-payments , limited the products available for condominiums , eliminated certain product features ( such as interest-only adjustable-rate loans and loans above certain ltv ratios ) , and we previously suspended home equity lending products with the exception of bridge loans between june 2010 and march 2012. the delinquency level related to loan originations prior to 2009 , compared to originations in 2009 and after , reflect the higher 57 credit standards to which we have subjected all new originations . as of september 30 , 2016 , loans originated prior to 2009 had a balance of $ 2.05 billion , of which $ 46.4 million , or 2.3 % , were delinquent , while loans originated in 2009 and after had a balance of $ 9.72 billion , of which $ 5.5 million , or 0.1 % , were delinquent . one aspect of our credit risk concern relates to high concentrations of our loans that are secured by residential real estate in specific states , particularly ohio and florida , in light of the difficulties that arose in connection with the 2008 housing crisis with respect to the real estate markets in those two states . at september 30 , 2016 , approximately 59.2 % and 16.6 % of the combined total of our residential core and construction loans held for investment were secured by properties in ohio and florida , respectively . our 30 or more days delinquency ratios on those loans in ohio and florida at september 30 , 2016 was 0.3 % in both states . our 30 or more days delinquency ratio for the entire core portfolio was also 0.3 % at september 30 , 2016 . as of september 30 , 2016 , approximately 39.0 % and 24.2 % of our home equity loans and lines of credit were secured by properties in ohio and florida , respectively . our 30 days or more delinquency ratios on those loans in ohio and florida at september 30 , 2016 were 0.8 % and 1.2 % , respectively . our 30 or more days delinquency ratio for the entire home equity loans and lines of credit portfolio at september 30 , 2016 was 0.7 % . while we focus our attention on , and are concerned with respect to the resolution of all loan delinquencies , our highest concern relates to loans that are secured by properties in florida . the “ allowance for loan losses ” portion in the preceding lending activities section of item 1. business in part i . — third federal savings and loan association of cleveland , provides extensive details regarding our loan portfolio composition , delinquency statistics , our methodology in evaluating our loan loss provisions and the adequacy of our allowance for loan losses . in an effort to moderate the concentration of our credit risk exposure in individual states , particularly ohio and florida , we have utilized direct mail marketing , our internet site and our customer service call center to extend our lending activities to other attractive geographic locations . currently , in addition to ohio and florida , we are actively lending in 19 other states and the district of columbia , and as a result of that activity , the concentration ratios of the combined total of our residential , core and construction loans held for investment for ohio and florida , as disclosed earlier in this paragraph , have trended downward from their september 30 , 2010 levels when the concentrations were 79.1 % in ohio and 19.0 % in florida . of the total mortgage and home equity originations for the years ended september 30 , 2016 and 2015 , 33.1 % and 37.6 % , respectively , are secured by properties in states other than ohio or florida . our residential home today loans are another area of credit risk concern .
","general . net income increased $ 6.7 million , or 10 % , to $ 72.6 million for the fiscal year ended september 30 , 2015 compared to $ 65.9 million for the fiscal year ended september 30 , 2014. this change was attributed to a $ 22.0 million , decrease in the provision for loan losses and a $ 2.4 million increase in non-interest income , partially offset by an increase of $ 12.5 million in non-interest expense and a decrease in net interest income of $ 1.3 million . interest and dividend income . total interest income increased $ 8.8 million , or 2 % , to $ 383.5 million for the fiscal year ended september 30 , 2015 compared to $ 374.7 million for the prior fiscal year . the increase in interest income resulted primarily from an increase in interest income from loans combined with increases in interest income from other interest-earning cash equivalents , and to a lesser extent , fhlb stock and mortgage-backed securities . interest income on loans increased $ 5.9 million , or 2 % , to $ 369.3 million during fiscal 2015 , compared to $ 363.4 million for the prior fiscal year . this increase was attributed to a $ 516.9 million increase in the average balance of loans to $ 10.95 billion in fiscal 2015 compared to $ 10.44 billion during the prior fiscal year as new loan production exceeded repayments and loan sales . the impact from the increase in the average balance of loans was partially offset by an 11 basis point decrease in the average yield on loans to 3.37 % from 3.48 % as historically low interest rates have kept the level of refinance activity relatively high resulting in new originations at lower rates compared to the rest of our portfolio .

"the discount rate assumption used to measure the postretirement benefit obligations is set by reference to a high quality corporate bond yield curve and the individual characteristics of the plan such as projected cash flow patterns and payment durations . the expected long-term rate of return on assets is based on the expected returns for each major asset class in which the plan story_separator_special_tag executive overview overview of significant events and financial results net income available to common shareholders totaled $ 2.3 billion for 2016 , a 16.7 % increase from the prior year . on a diluted per common share basis , earnings for 2016 were $ 2.77 , compared to $ 2.56 for 2015 . bb & t 's results of operations for 2016 produced a return on average assets of 1.12 % and a return on average common shareholders ' equity of 8.57 % compared to prior year ratios of 1.08 % and 8.34 % , respectively . these results include merger-related and restructuring charges of $ 171 million for 2016 compared to $ 165 million for 2015. net interest income and noninterest income were both higher following acquisition activity in 2015 and 2016. noninterest expense was higher due to increases in headcount and locations , primarily the result of the acquisitions , and the provision for credit losses increased due to higher provisions largely related to energy credits . on april 1 , 2016 , bb & t acquired national penn for total consideration of $ 1.6 billion , which consisted of approximately $ 555 million in cash and the remainder in common stock . national penn had 126 financial centers , $ 10.1 billion of total assets and $ 6.6 billion of deposits . also on april 1 , 2016 , bb & t purchased insurance broker cgsc north america holdings corporation ( `` swett & crawford '' ) from cooper gay swett & crawford for $ 461 million in cash . during the third quarter of 2016 , branch bank entered into an agreement with the fdic that terminated the loss share agreements related to colonial . branch bank made a payment of approximately $ 230 million to the fdic as consideration for the early termination . as a result , the fdic loss share receivable/payable associated with the indemnification by the fdic was eliminated and pre-tax expense of $ 18 million was recognized during the third quarter of 2016. no future loss sharing or gain sharing will occur related to the colonial acquisition . during the third quarter of 2016 , the company reached an agreement with the u.s. department of justice that settled certain legacy mortgage matters involving the origination of mortgage loans insured by the fha . the company had previously recorded an $ 85 million reserve in 2014 in connection with this matter . pursuant to the agreement , the company paid $ 83 million and separately received a recovery of $ 71 million , resulting in a net benefit of $ 73 million for the third quarter of 2016. additionally , during the third quarter of 2016 , the company made a $ 50 million charitable contribution . during the fourth quarter , bb & t recognized $ 34 million of pre-tax charges for securities duration adjustments and hedge ineffectiveness , which were primarily due to higher interest rates . also impacting the fourth quarter earnings was a $ 31 million release of mortgage repurchase reserves , which was primarily driven by lower anticipated loan repurchase requests . bb & t 's revenue for 2016 was $ 10.8 billion . on a te basis , revenue was $ 11.0 billion , which represents an increase of $ 1.2 billion compared to 2015 . net interest income on a te basis was $ 743 million higher than the prior year , which reflects a $ 753 million increase in interest income and a $ 10 million increase in interest expense . noninterest income increased $ 453 million for the year , driven by improvements in fdic loss share income , higher insurance income primarily from the acquisition of swett and crawford , higher securities gains and losses , and increases in other categories of income that include the impact of the susquehanna and national penn acquisitions . nim was 3.39 % for 2016 , compared to 3.32 % for the prior year . average earning assets increased $ 18.6 billion , or 10.8 % , while average interest-bearing liabilities increased $ 11.3 billion , or 9.3 % , both of which were primarily driven by acquisitions . the annualized te yield on the total loan portfolio for 2016 was 4.30 % , up four basis points compared to the prior year . the annualized te yield on the average securities portfolio was 2.33 % , down three basis points compared to the prior year primarily due to securities duration adjustments . the provision for credit losses was $ 572 million , compared to $ 428 million for the prior year . this increase reflects the higher provisions largely related to energy credits . npas increased $ 101 million compared to 2015 . this included a $ 160 million increase in npls primarily within commercial lending , and a $ 59 million decrease in foreclosed real estate and other property . net charge-offs for 2016 were $ 532 million , compared to $ 436 million for the prior year . the ratio of the alll to net charge-offs was 2.80x for 2016 , compared to 3.36x in 2015 . 31 noninterest expense increased $ 455 million primarily due to higher personnel expense , which was primarily the result of acquisition activity . other categories of noninterest expense reflected higher costs due to the impact of acquisitions . partially offsetting these increases were lower losses from the extinguishment of debt , as 2015 included a $ 172 million charge compared to a small gain in 2016. in addition to the impact from acquisitions , regulatory charges reflect the fdic surcharge assessed against large banks that was implemented in the third quarter of 2016. story_separator_special_tag the nim was 3.39 % in 2016 compared with 3.32 % in 2015. the increase in the nim reflects higher yields on loans and improved funding mix , partially offset by lower yields on securities . the average annualized te yield for total loans and leases was 4.30 % for 2016 , compared to 4.26 % for the prior year . the increase was primarily due to acquisitions , partially offset by lower yields on new loan originations and the runoff of higher yielding loans acquired from the fdic . the te yield on the total securities portfolio was 2.33 % for the year ended december 31 , 2016 , compared to 2.36 % for the prior year . the average rate paid on interest-bearing deposits for 2016 dropped to 0.23 % , from 0.24 % in 2015. this improvement was driven by changes in mix , with time deposits representing a lower percentage of interest-bearing deposits at december 31 , 2016. the rate paid on average short-term borrowings was 0.35 % in 2016 , compared to 0.15 % in 2015. the increase in the rate on short-term borrowings reflects the federal funds target rate increase from december 2015. the average rate on long-term debt was 2.13 % during 2016 , flat compared to the prior year . at december 31 , 2016 , the targeted federal funds rate was a range of 0.50 % to 0.75 % . 2015 compared to 2014 for 2015 , net interest income on a te basis totaled $ 5.7 billion , an increase of $ 221 million or 4.0 % compared to the prior year . the increase reflects higher interest income due to acquisitions and organic loan growth , partially offset by lower yields on new loans and securities and runoff in the loan portfolio acquired from the fdic . interest expense declined , reflecting lower rates and improvement in the mix of funding sources . the average cost of interest-bearing deposits declined two basis points to 0.24 % , reflecting reductions in time deposits and growth in interest checking and money market and savings . the average cost of long-term debt declined from 2.36 % to 2.13 % , primarily due to the early extinguishment of $ 2.0 billion of higher-cost fhlb advances during the last two years . the nim was 3.32 % in 2015 compared with 3.42 % in 2014. the decline in the nim reflects lower yields on loans and securities , partially offset by the lower funding costs described above . the average annualized te yield for total loans and leases was 4.26 % for 2015 , compared to 4.42 % for the prior year . the decrease was primarily due to lower yields on new loan originations and the runoff of higher yielding loans acquired from the fdic , partially offset by acquisition impact . the te yield on the total securities portfolio was 2.36 % for the year ended december 31 , 2015 , compared to 2.45 % for the prior year . the average rate paid on interest-bearing deposits for 2015 dropped to 0.24 % , from 0.26 % in 2014. this improvement was driven by changes in mix , with time deposits representing a lower percentage of interest-bearing deposits at december 31 , 2015. the rate paid on average short-term borrowings was 0.15 % in 2015 , compared to 0.13 % in 2014. the average rate on long-term debt during 2015 was 2.13 % , compared to 2.36 % for the prior year . this decline reflects the previously mentioned early extinguishment of higher-cost fhlb advances . 33

"during fiscal 2012 , $ 0.4 million of these story_separator_special_tag background as discussed in item 1 , business ,  we are a global diversified company that manufactures a broad range of industrial products and systems and are organized into four reportable segments , industrial , energy , electrical and engineered solutions . the industrial segment is primarily involved in the design , manufacture and distribution of branded hydraulic and mechanical tools to the maintenance , industrial , infrastructure and production automation markets . the energy segment provides joint integrity products and services , as well as umbilical , rope and cable solutions to the global oil & gas , power generation and energy markets . the electrical segment designs , manufactures and distributes a broad range of electrical products to the retail diy , wholesale , oem , solar , utility , marine and other harsh environment markets . the engineered solutions segment provides highly engineered position and motion control systems to oems in various vehicle markets , as well as a variety of other products to the industrial and agricultural markets . our businesses provide a vast array of products and services across multiple customers and geographies which results in significant diversification to our overall enterprise . most end markets we serve slowed dramatically in fiscal 2009 and into early fiscal 2010 , as a result of the global recession . since then , the majority of our end markets have improved , the result of increased global industrial output , improved worldwide demand for energy , elevated industrial manufacturing activities and increased production of vehicles for the heavy-duty truck , construction , military and agricultural markets . the long-term sales growth and profitability of our segments will depend not only on improved demand in end markets and the overall economic environment , but also on our ability to identify , consummate and integrate strategic acquisitions , develop and market innovative new products , expand our business activity geographically and continuously improve operational excellence . we remain focused on maintaining our financial strength by continually adjusting our cost structure to reflect changes in demand levels , if needed , and by proactively managing working capital and cash flow generation . our priorities during fiscal 2012 include a continued focus on operational excellence , cash flow generation and growth initiatives ( new product development , market share gains and strategic acquisitions ) . results of operations the comparability of operating results has been impacted by acquisitions , divestitures and the economic conditions that existed in the end markets we serve . the operating results of acquired businesses are included in our consolidated financial statements only since their respective acquisition date . in addition to acquisitions , changes in foreign currency exchange rates also influence our financial results as approximately half of our sales are denominated in currencies other than the u.s. dollar . the year-over-year weakening of the u.s. dollar during fiscal 2011 favorably impacted our operating results due to the translation of non-u.s. dollar denominated results . impairment charges , restructuring costs and the related benefits from previously completed restructuring projects also impact the comparability of financial results . since fiscal 2009 we have taken significant actions to address our cost structure , including workforce reductions , consolidation of facilities and the centralization of certain selling and administrative functions . 17 historical financial data ( in millions ) replace_table_token_7_th consolidated net sales increased by approximately $ 284 million ( 25 % ) from $ 1,161 million in fiscal 2010 to $ 1,445 million in fiscal 2011. excluding the $ 119 million of sales from acquired businesses and the $ 23 million favorable impact of foreign currency exchange rate changes , fiscal 2011 consolidated core sales increased 13 % . consolidated net sales increased by approximately $ 43 million ( 4 % ) from $ 1,118 million in fiscal 2009 to $ 1,161 million in fiscal 2010. excluding the $ 14 million of sales from acquired businesses and the $ 12 million favorable impact of foreign currency exchange rate changes , fiscal 2010 consolidated core sales increased 2 % compared to the prior year . changes in net sales at the segment level are discussed in further detail below . consolidated operating profit for fiscal 2011 was $ 194 million , compared with $ 122 million and $ 68 million for fiscal 2010 and 2009 , respectively . in addition to the impact of economic conditions , the comparability between periods is impacted by acquisitions , the $ 31 million impairment charge in fiscal 2009 and the timing and amount of restructuring charges and related benefits . changes in operating profit at the segment level are discussed in further detail below . 18 story_separator_special_tag 20 fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010 compared to the prior year , fiscal 2011 electrical segment net sales increased $ 52 million ( 22 % ) to $ 286 million , with mastervolt contributing sales of $ 49 million since its acquisition in december 2010. excluding sales from this acquisition and favorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates , core sales were flat for fiscal 2011 , compared to the prior year period . electrical segment operating profit for fiscal 2011 was $ 21 million compared to $ 20 million in fiscal 2010. excluding restructuring costs , operating profits declined in fiscal 2011 as a result of the timing of raw material cost increases and related customer price increases , expedited freight costs and temporary operating inefficiencies as we completed facility consolidations . unfavorable mix , resulting from the mastervolt acquisition , also negatively impacted current year operating profit margins , despite the higher sales levels and lower incentive compensation costs . fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009 electrical segment net sales decreased by $ 8 million ( 3 % ) to $ 234 million in fiscal 2010. foreign currency rate changes favorably impacted fiscal 2010 sales by $ 2 million . story_separator_special_tag as a result , in the third quarter of fiscal 2009 , we recognized a $ 32 million non-cash asset impairment charge related to the goodwill , indefinite lived intangibles and long-lived assets of the harsh environment electrical business ( electrical segment ) . financing costs , net all debt is considered to be for general corporate purposes and therefore financing costs have not been allocated to our segments . net financing costs were $ 32 million for the years ended august 31 , 2011 and 2010 22 and $ 42 million for the year ended august 31 , 2009. the $ 10 million reduction in financing costs in fiscal 2010 , relative to fiscal 2009 , was the result of substantially lower average debt levels and reduced interest rates on variable rate debt . income tax expense our income tax expense is impacted by a number of factors , including the amount of taxable earnings derived in foreign jurisdictions with tax rates that are lower than the u.s. federal statutory rate , state tax rates in the jurisdictions where we do business , tax minimization planning and our ability to utilize various tax credits and net operating loss carryforwards . the effective income tax rate for fiscal 2011 was 21.8 % , compared to 21.1 % and 2.3 % in fiscal 2010 and 2009 , respectively . the income tax expense recognized in fiscal 2011 and 2010 benefited from the utilization of foreign tax credits , increased taxable earnings in foreign jurisdictions ( with statutory tax rates lower than the u.s. statutory rate ) and favorable changes in valuation allowances , which were offset somewhat by unfavorable provision to return adjustments and additional provisions for unrecognized tax benefits . the lower effective tax rate in fiscal 2009 is the result of the tax benefit on the impairment and restructuring charges being recognized at the domestic tax rate ( which is higher than our consolidated global effective tax rate ) and the benefit of income tax reserve adjustments resulting from settling tax audits for amounts less than previously accrued and the lapsing of various tax statutes of limitations . discontinued operations discontinued operations reflects the results of the divested european electrical ( sold in fiscal 2010 ) , and acme aerospace and bh electronics , inc. ( sold in fiscal 2009 ) businesses . see note 3 discontinued operations in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further information . the following table summarizes the results of discontinued operations ( in millions ) : replace_table_token_12_th ( 1 ) includes non-cash asset impairment charges of $ 36 million ( european electrical ) and $ 27 million ( bh electronics ) in fiscal 2010 and 2009 , respectively . liquidity and capital resources the following table summarizes the cash flow attributable to operating , investing and financing activities ( in millions ) : replace_table_token_13_th 23 during fiscal 2011 we generated $ 172 million of cash flow from operations reflecting improved earnings from continuing operations and effective working capital management . we utilized the cash flow from operations , borrowings under our senior credit facility and the $ 4 million of proceeds from the sale of the european electrical business to fund the $ 313 million of capital deployed on the acquisitions of mastervolt and weasler and $ 23 million of capital expenditures . in fiscal 2010 , cash flows from operating activities were $ 121 million . excluding the $ 37 million negative impact on working capital due to the expiration of our accounts receivable securitization program , net cash provided by operating activities increased relative to the prior year as a result of increased earnings from continuing operations , effective working capital management and the receipt of income tax refunds . these operating cash flows and the $ 8 million of proceeds from the sale of a portion of the european electrical product line in the second quarter of fiscal 2010 , funded $ 46 million of acquisitions and $ 20 million of capital expenditures , while reducing net debt by $ 67 million . effective cash flow management during fiscal 2009 resulted in substantial cash flow from operating activities of $ 147 million and an improved financial position at august 31 , 2009. operating cash flows benefited from lower working capital , given the decline in sales levels . during fiscal 2009 , cash flows from operations , along with the $ 125 million proceeds from a follow-on equity offering and $ 38 million of proceeds from the divestiture of two businesses , funded $ 239 million of business acquisitions ( including the acquisition of the cortland companies ) , $ 21 million of capital expenditures and a net reduction in debt of $ 147 million . primary working capital management we use primary working capital ( pwc ) as a percentage of sales as a key indicator of working capital management . we define this metric as the sum of net accounts receivable and net inventory less accounts payable , divided by the past three months sales annualized . the following table shows the components of the metric ( amounts in millions ) : replace_table_token_14_th our net primary working capital percentage increased year-over-year from 16 % to 17 % as of august 31 , 2011 , primarily due to the fiscal 2011 acquisitions and a conscious effort to increase inventory levels in certain businesses to meet growing customer demand . during fiscal 2011 , excluding acquisitions and changes in foreign currency exchange rates , accounts receivable decreased $ 3 million and inventory increased $ 29 million , while accounts payable increased $ 7 million . liquidity our senior credit facility , which was expanded and extended during the second quarter of fiscal 2011 , includes a $ 600 million revolving credit facility , a $ 100 million term loan and a $ 300 million expansion option .
","segment results industrial segment during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011 , the industrial segment delivered its sixth consecutive quarter of year-over-year double digit core sales growth due to robust demand across nearly all geographic regions . this increased sales volume , coupled with the benefits of previous restructuring actions , drove significant year-over-year improvement in operating profits . the industrial segment continues to focus on operational excellence ( manufacturing , distribution , sourcing and supply chain management ) , the commercialization of new products and expansion of its business in fast growing regions and vertical markets . the following table sets forth the results of operations for the industrial segment ( in millions ) : replace_table_token_8_th fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2010 , industrial segment net sales increased $ 93 million ( 31 % ) during fiscal 2011. the acquisition of two integrated solutions businesses ( hydrospex and team hydrotec ) contributed $ 36 million of sales for the twelve months ended august 31 , 2011. excluding sales from these acquisitions and the weaker u.s. dollar ( $ 8 million ) , core sales growth for fiscal 2011 was 19 % . in addition to generally improved macroeconomic conditions , the increased sales were the result of new product introductions and increased demand from distributors and end users in the mining , oil & gas and general maintenance industries . industrial segment operating profits reached $ 98 million for the year ended august 31 , 2011 compared to $ 66 million during fiscal 2010. fiscal 2011 operating profit comparisons were favorably impacted by increased sales volumes and a $ 6 million reduction in restructuring costs . the expansion of the industrial segment operating profit margin , despite unfavorable acquisition mix and additional costs associated with growth initiatives , was the result of a lower cost structure from past restructuring actions and increased production levels ( higher absorption of fixed manufacturing costs ) .

statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states ( “ gaap ” ) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our financial statements and accompanying notes . significant estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported in the financial statements include impairment consideration and valuation of goodwill and intangible assets , deferred tax valuation allowances , allowance for doubtful accounts , revenue allocation of multi-element arrangements and the fair value of stock options granted under our stock-based compensation plans . due to the inherent uncertainties involved in making estimates , actual results reported in future periods may be different from those estimates . we believe that there are several accounting policies that are critical to understanding our historical and future performance , as these policies affect the reported amounts of revenue and the more significant areas involving management 's judgments and estimates . these significant accounting policies relate to revenue recognition , stock based compensation , deferred taxes , goodwill and intangible asset valuation and impairment , and commitments and contingencies . these policies and our procedures related to these policies are described in detail below . valuation of goodwill and other long-lived assets our long-lived assets include property and equipment , goodwill and intangible assets . as of december 31 , 2018 , the balances of property and equipment , goodwill and intangible assets , all net of accumulated depreciation and amortization and impairments , were $ 264,583 , $ 8,101,661 and $ 306,575 , respectively . as of december 31 , 2017 , the balances of property and equipment , goodwill and intangible assets , all net of accumulated depreciation and amortization and impairments , were $ 211,602 , $ 8,101,661 and $ 463,578 , respectively . we depreciate property and equipment and amortize intangible assets that have finite lives over their estimated useful lives . for purposes of determining whether there are any impairment losses , as further discussed below , management evaluates the carrying amounts of identifiable long-lived tangible and intangible assets , including their estimated useful lives , when indicators of impairment are present as more fully described below . based on our review of the carrying amounts of the long-lived tangible and intangible assets with finite lives , we may also determine that shorter estimated useful lives are appropriate . in that event , we record depreciation and amortization over shorter future periods , which would reduce our earnings . goodwill the excess of the purchase consideration over the fair value of the assets of the acquired businesses is considered goodwill . under authoritative guidance , purchased goodwill is not amortized , but rather it is periodically reviewed for impairment . we had goodwill of $ 8,101,661 as of december 31 , 2018 and 2017. this goodwill resulted from the acquisition of mobilisa , inc. and positive access corporation . 24 for the years ended december 31 , 2018 and 2017 , we performed our annual impairment test of goodwill in the fourth quarter . under authoritative guidance , we can use industry and company specific qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that impairment exists , before using a two-step quantitative analysis . events or changes in circumstances which could trigger an impairment review include macroeconomic conditions , industry and market conditions , cost factors , overall financial performance , other entity specific events and sustained decrease in share price . we performed the first step of the goodwill impairment test in order to identify potential impairment by comparing our fair value of the company to our carrying amount , including goodwill . the fair value was determined using the weighting of certain valuation techniques , including both income and market approaches which include a discounted cash flow analysis , an estimation of an implied control premium , in addition to our market capitalization on the measurement date . the implied control premium selected was developed based on certain observable market data of comparable companies . the market capitalization is sensitive to the volatility of our stock price . although we believe that the factors considered in the impairment analysis are reasonable , changes in any one of the assumptions used could have produced a different result which may have led to an impairment charge . any future impairment loss could have a material adverse effect on our long-term assets and operating expenses in the period in which impairment is determined to exist . for the years ended december 31 , 2018 and 2017 , we determined that the fair value was more than our carrying amount and therefore the second step of the goodwill impairment test was not required . intangible assets intangible assets include trade names , patents and non-contractual customer relationships as described more fully in note 5. we use the straight-line method to amortize these assets over their estimated useful lives . we review our long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be fully recoverable in accordance with accounting standards codification ( “ asc ” ) topic 360. to determine recoverability of its long-lived assets , we evaluate the probability that future undiscounted net cash flows , without interest charges , will be less than the carrying amount of the assets . impairment is measured at fair value . story_separator_special_tag in many cases , the accounting treatment of a transaction is specifically dictated by generally accepted accounting principles , with no need for management 's judgment in

during 2018 we had a revolving credit facility with northwest bank ( “ northwest ” ) that allows for borrowings to the lesser of ( i ) $ 2,000,000 or ( ii ) 95 % of the balance in our money market account less $ 250,000. the borrowings are secured by our existing deposit and money market accounts with northwest . the facility bears interest at a rate consistent with northwest 's money market account ( 1.51 % at december 31 , 2018 ) plus 3 % . interest is payable monthly and the principal is due upon maturity on may 22 , 2019. as of december 31 , 2018 , there were no amounts outstanding under this facility and unused availability under this facility was $ 2,000,000 . 27 on january 10 , 2019 we terminated the above facility with northwest and on february 6 , 2019 we entered into a similar facility with citibank that allows borrowings up to $ 2,000,000 and are secured by collateralized accounts . the facility bears interest at a rate of citibank 's base rate minus 2 % . interest is payable monthly . as of march 21 , 2019 , there were no amounts outstanding under this facility and unused availability under this facility was $ 2,000,000. we currently anticipate that our available cash , as well as cash from the previously mentioned stock offerings , and expected cash from operations and availability under the revolving credit agreement , will be sufficient to meet our anticipated working capital and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next 12 months . we keep the option open to raise additional funds to respond to business contingencies which may include the need to fund more rapid expansion , fund additional marketing expenditures , develop new markets for our technology , enhance our operating infrastructure , respond to competitive pressures , or acquire complementary businesses or necessary technologies . there can be no assurance that we will be able to secure the additional funds when needed or obtain such on terms satisfactory to us , if at all . we have filed a universal shelf registration statement on form s-3 with the securities and exchange commission ( “ sec ” ) , which became effective july 19 , 2010. under the shelf registration statement , we may offer and sell , from time to time in the future in one or more public offerings , our common stock , preferred stock , warrants , and units . the aggregate initial offering price of all securities sold by us will not exceed $ 25,000,000 , and , pursuant to sec rules , we may only sell up to one-third of the market cap held by non-affiliate stockholders in any 12-month period . we renewed this registration statement with the sec on july 31 , 2013 and it was declared effective august 6 , 2013. we renewed this registration statement with the sec on october 21 , 2016 and it was declared effective november 4 , 2016. the specific terms of any future offering , including the prices and use of proceeds , will be determined at the time of any such offering and will be described in detail in a prospectus supplement which will be filed with the sec at the time of the offering . the shelf registration statement is designed to give us the flexibility to access additional capital at some point in the future when market conditions are appropriate . we are not currently involved in any legal or regulatory proceeding , or arbitration , the outcome of which is expected to have a material adverse effect on our business . adjusted ebitda we use adjusted ebitda as a non-gaap financial performance measurement . adjusted ebitda is calculated by adding back to net loss interest and other income , income taxes , impairments of long-lived assets and goodwill , depreciation , amortization and stock-based compensation expense . adjusted ebitda is provided to investors to supplement the results of operations reported in accordance with gaap . management believes that adjusted ebitda provides an additional tool for investors to use in comparing our financial results with other companies that also use adjusted ebitda in their communications to investors . by excluding non-cash charges such as impairments of long-lived assets and goodwill , amortization , depreciation and stock-based compensation , as well as non-operating charges for interest and income taxes , investors can evaluate our operations and can compare its results on a more consistent basis to the results of other companies . in addition , adjusted ebitda is one of the primary measures management uses to monitor and evaluate financial and operating results . we consider adjusted ebitda to be an important indicator of our operational strength and performance of our business and a useful measure of our historical operating trends . however , there are significant limitations to the use of adjusted ebitda since it excludes interest income , impairments of long lived assets and goodwill , stock based compensation expense , all of which impact our profitability , as well as depreciation and amortization related to the use of long term assets which benefit multiple periods . we believe that these limitations are compensated by providing adjusted ebitda only with gaap net loss and clearly identifying the difference between the two measures . consequently , adjusted ebitda should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net loss presented in accordance with gaap . adjusted ebitda as defined us may not be comparable with similarly named measures provided by other entities .

"the company recognized a non-cash gain story_separator_special_tag the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this report . we make statements in this section that are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws . for a complete discussion of forward-looking statements , see the section in this form 10-k entitled statements regarding forward-looking information. certain risk factors may cause actual results , performance or achievements to differ materially from those expressed or implied by the following discussion . for a discussion of such risk factors , see the section in this form 10-k entitled risk factors. amounts in thousands , except share and per share data . overview we are a fully integrated , self-administered and self-managed real estate investment trust , or reit , formed to continue the business commenced in 1977 by extra space storage llc and its subsidiaries to own , operate , manage , acquire , develop and redevelop professionally managed self-storage stores . at december 31 , 2014 , we owned , had ownership interests in , or managed 1,088 operating stores in 35 states , washington , d.c. and puerto rico . of these 1,088 operating stores , we owned 557 , we held joint venture interests in 271 stores , and our taxable reit subsidiary , extra space management , inc. , operated an additional 260 stores that are owned by third parties . these operating stores contain approximately 80.4 million square feet of rentable space in approximately 725,000 units and currently serve a customer base of approximately 650,000 tenants . our stores are generally situated in convenient , highly visible locations clustered around large population centers such as atlanta , baltimore/washington , d.c. , boston , chicago , dallas , houston , las vegas , los angeles , miami , new york city , orlando , philadelphia , phoenix , st. petersburg/tampa and san francisco/oakland . these areas all enjoy above average population growth and income levels . the clustering of our assets around these population centers enables us to reduce our operating costs through economies of scale . we consider a store to be in the lease-up stage after it has been issued a certificate of occupancy , but before it has achieved stabilization . a store is considered to be stabilized once it has achieved an 80 % occupancy rate for a full year measured as of january 1 , or has been open for three years . to maximize the performance of our stores , we employ industry-leading revenue management systems . developed by our management team , these systems enable us to analyze , set and adjust rental rates in real time across our portfolio in order to respond to changing market conditions . we believe our systems and processes allow us to more proactively manage revenues . we derive substantially all of our revenues from rents received from tenants under leases at each of our wholly-owned stores , from management fees on the stores we manage for joint-venture partners and unaffiliated third parties , and from our tenant reinsurance program . our management fee is generally equal to approximately 6.0 % of cash collected from total revenues generated by the managed stores . we also receive an asset management fee of 0.5 % of the total asset value from one of our joint ventures . we operate in competitive markets , often where consumers have multiple stores from which to choose . competition has impacted , and will continue to impact , our store results . we experience seasonal fluctuations in occupancy levels , with occupancy levels generally higher in the summer months due to increased moving activity . our operating results depend materially on our ability to lease available self-storage units , to actively manage unit rental rates , and on the ability of our tenants to make required rental payments . we believe that we are able to respond quickly and effectively to changes in local , regional and national economic conditions by adjusting rental rates through the combination of our revenue management team and our industry-leading technology systems . 28 we continue to evaluate a range of new initiatives and opportunities in order to enable us to maximize stockholder value . our strategies to maximize stockholder value include the following : maximize the performance of our stores through strategic , efficient and proactive management . we pursue revenue-generating and expense-minimizing opportunities in our operations . our revenue management team seeks to maximize revenue by responding to changing market conditions through our technology system 's ability to provide real-time , interactive rental rate and discount management . our size allows us greater ability than the majority of our competitors to implement more effective online marketing programs , which we believe will attract more customers to our stores at a lower net cost . acquire self-storage stores . our acquisitions team continues to pursue the acquisition of multi-store portfolios and single stores that we believe can provide stockholder value . we have established a reputation as a reliable , ethical buyer , which we believe enhances our ability to negotiate and close acquisitions . in addition , we believe our status as an upreit enables flexibility when structuring deals . we continue to see available acquisitions on which to bid and are seeing increasing prices . however , we remain a disciplined buyer and look for acquisitions that will strengthen our portfolio and increase stockholder value . expand our management business . our management business enables us to generate increased revenues through management fees and expand our geographic footprint . we believe this expanded footprint enables us to reduce our operating costs through economies of scale . in addition , we see our management business as a future acquisition pipeline . we pursue strategic relationships with owners whose stores would enhance our portfolio in the event an opportunity arises to acquire such stores . critical accounting policies and estimates our financial statements have been prepared in accordance with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles . story_separator_special_tag when we determine that an event that may indicate impairment has occurred , we compare the carrying value of the related long-lived assets to the undiscounted future net operating cash flows attributable to the assets . an impairment loss is recorded if the net carrying value of the assets exceeds the undiscounted future net operating cash flows attributable to the assets . the impairment loss recognized equals the excess of net carrying value over the related fair value of the assets . when real estate assets are identified as held for sale , we discontinue depreciating the assets and estimate the fair value of the assets , net of selling costs . if the estimated fair values , net of selling costs , of the assets that have been identified for sale are less than the net carrying value of the assets , then a valuation allowance is established . the operations of assets held for sale or sold during the period are generally presented as discontinued operations for all periods presented . 30 investments in real estate ventures : our investments in real estate joint ventures where we have significant influence but not control , and joint ventures which are vies in which we are not the primary beneficiary , are recorded under the equity method of accounting on the accompanying consolidated financial statements . under the equity method , our investment in real estate ventures is stated at cost and adjusted for our share of net earnings or losses and reduced by distributions . equity in earnings of real estate ventures is generally recognized based on our ownership interest in the earnings of each of the unconsolidated real estate ventures . for the purposes of presentation in the statement of cash flows , we follow the look through approach for classification of distributions from joint ventures . under this approach , distributions are reported under operating cash flow unless the facts and circumstances of a specific distribution clearly indicate that it is a return of capital ( e.g. , a liquidating dividend or distribution of the proceeds from the joint venture 's sale of assets ) in which case it is reported as an investing activity . our management assesses annually whether there are any indicators that the value of our investments in unconsolidated real estate ventures may be impaired and when events or circumstances indicate that there may be impairment . an investment is impaired if management 's estimate of the fair value of the investment , using significant unobservable inputs , is less than its carrying value . to the extent impairment has occurred and is considered to be other than temporary , the loss is measured as the excess of the carrying amount of the investment over the fair value of the investment . derivative instruments and hedging activities : the accounting for changes in the fair value of derivatives depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation . derivatives used to hedge the exposure to changes in the fair value of an asset , liability or firm commitment attributable to a particular risk , are considered fair value hedges . derivatives used to hedge the exposure to variability in expected future cash flows , or other types of forecasted transactions , are considered cash flow hedges . for derivatives designated as fair value hedges , changes in the fair value of the derivative and the hedged item related to the hedged risk are recognized in earnings . for derivatives designated as cash flow hedges , the effective portion of changes in the fair value of the derivative is initially reported in other comprehensive income , outside of earnings and subsequently reclassified to earnings when the hedged transaction affects earnings . revenue and expense recognition : rental revenues are recognized as earned based upon amounts that are currently due from tenants . leases are generally on month-to-month terms . prepaid rents are recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the leases . promotional discounts are recognized as a reduction to rental income over the promotional period . late charges , administrative fees , merchandise sales and truck rentals are recognized in income when earned . management fee revenues are recognized monthly as services are performed and in accordance with the terms of the related management agreements . equity in earnings of real estate entities is recognized based on our ownership interest in the earnings of each of the unconsolidated real estate entities . interest income is recognized as earned . property expenses , including utilities , property taxes , repairs and maintenance and other costs to manage the facilities are recognized as incurred . we accrue for property tax expense based upon invoice amounts , estimates and historical trends . if these estimates are incorrect , the timing of expense recognition could be affected . tenant reinsurance premiums are recognized as revenue over the period of insurance coverage . we record an unpaid claims liability at the end of each period based on existing unpaid claims and historical claims payment history . the unpaid claims liability represents an estimate of the ultimate cost to settle all unpaid claims as of each period end , including both reported but unpaid claims and claims that may have been incurred but have not been reported . we use a third party claims administrator to adjust all tenant reinsurance claims received . the administrator evaluates each claim to determine the ultimate claim loss and includes an estimate for claims that may have been incurred but not reported . annually , a third party actuary evaluates the adequacy of the unpaid 31 claims liability . prior year claim reserves are adjusted as experience develops or new information becomes known . the impact of such adjustments is included in the current period operations . the unpaid claims liability is not discounted to its present value . each tenant chooses the amount of insurance coverage they want through the tenant reinsurance program .

( phillips 66 pdi ) . we are a growth-oriented master limited partnership formed to own , operate , develop and acquire primarily fee-based crude oil , refined petroleum products and natural gas liquids ( ngl ) pipelines and terminals , and other transportation and midstream assets . our common units trade on the new york stock exchange under the symbol psxp . basis of presentation we have acquired assets from phillips 66 that were considered transfers of businesses between entities under common control . this required the transactions to be accounted for as if the transfers had occurred at the beginning of the period of transfer , with prior periods retrospectively adjusted to furnish comparative information . we refer to these pre-acquisition operations as those of our “ predecessors. ” see the “ basis of presentation ” section of note 1—business and basis of presentation , in the notes to consolidated financial statements , for additional information on the content and comparability of our historical financial statements . executive overview net income attributable to the partnership was $ 796 million in 2018 . we generated cash from operations of $ 892 million and raised net proceeds of $ 228 million through debt and equity financings . this cash was primarily used to fund capital expenditures and make quarterly cash distributions to our unitholders and general partner . as of december 31 , 2018 , we had cash and cash equivalents of $ 1 million , total debt of $ 3,048 million , and unused capacity under our revolving credit facility of $ 625 million . how we evaluate our operations our management uses a variety of financial and operating metrics to analyze our performance , including : ( 1 ) volumes handled ; ( 2 ) operating and maintenance expenses ; ( 3 ) net income ( loss ) before net interest expense , income taxes , depreciation and amortization ( ebitda ) ; ( 4 ) adjusted ebitda ; and ( 5 ) distributable cash flow . volumes handled the amount of revenue we generate primarily depends on the volumes of crude oil , refined petroleum products and ngl that we handle in our pipeline , terminal , rail rack , processing , storage and ngl fractionator systems . in addition , our equity affiliates generate revenue from transporting and terminaling ngl , crude oil and refined petroleum products . these volumes are primarily affected by the supply of , and demand for , ngl , crude oil and refined petroleum products in the markets served directly or indirectly by our assets , as well as the operational status of the refineries served by our assets . phillips 66 has committed to minimum throughput volumes under many of our commercial agreements . 36 index to financial statements operating and maintenance expenses our management seeks to maximize the profitability of our operations by effectively managing operating and maintenance expenses . these expenses primarily consist of labor expenses ( including contractor services ) , utility costs , and repair and maintenance expenses . operating and maintenance expenses generally remain relatively stable across broad ranges of throughput volumes but can fluctuate from period to period depending on the mix of activities , particularly maintenance activities , performed during the period . although we seek to manage our maintenance expenditures on our facilities to avoid significant variability in our quarterly cash flows , we balance this approach with our high standards of safety and environmental stewardship , such that critical maintenance is regularly performed . our operating and maintenance expenses are also affected by volumetric gains/losses resulting from variances in meter readings and other measurement methods , as well as volume fluctuations due to pressure and temperature changes . under certain commercial agreements with phillips 66 , the value of any ngl , crude oil , or refined petroleum product volumetric gains and losses are determined by reference to the monthly average reference price for the applicable commodity . any gains/losses under these provisions decrease or increase , respectively , our operating and maintenance expenses in the period in which they are realized . these contractual volumetric gain/loss provisions could increase variability in our operating and maintenance expenses . ebitda , adjusted ebitda and distributable cash flow we define ebitda as net income ( loss ) plus net interest expense , income taxes , depreciation and amortization attributable to both the partnership and our predecessors . adjusted ebitda is the ebitda attributable to the partnership after deducting the ebitda attributable to our predecessors , further adjusted for : the proportional share of equity affiliates ' net interest expense , income taxes and depreciation and amortization . story_separator_special_tag the net proceeds were used in part to fund the cash portion of the bakken

$ 0.678375 per unit , beginning for the quarter ended december 31 , 2017 , with a prorated amount from the date of issuance . following the third anniversary of the issuance of the preferred units , the holders of the preferred units will receive as a quarterly distribution the greater of $ 0.678375 per unit or the amount of per-unit distributions paid to common unitholders as if such preferred units had converted into common units immediately prior to the record date . the holders of the preferred units may convert their preferred units into common units , on a one-for-one basis , at any time after the second anniversary of the issuance date , in full or in part , subject to minimum conversion amounts and conditions . after the third anniversary of the issuance date , we may convert

statements , for additional information on the preferred unit conversion features . atm program our initial $ 250 million continuous offering of common units , or at-the-market ( atm ) program , was completed in june 2018. at that time , we commenced issuing common units under our second $ 250 million atm program . for the year ended december 31 , 2018 , on a settlement date basis , we had issued an aggregate of 2,532,096 common units under our atm programs , generating net proceeds of $ 128 million . during the year ended december 31 , 2017 , on a settlement-date basis , we issued an

purposes , which may include debt repayment , acquisitions , capital expenditures and additions to working capital . issuances of common units under our atm programs can reduce our general partner 's interest below 2 percent . we expect the general partner 's interest to be periodically restored to 2 percent in connection with dropdown transactions or through direct equity contributions . however , these future contributions from our general partner can not be assured . at december 31 , 2018 , our general partner 's interest was slightly less than 2 percent . 44 index to financial statements

discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ( md & a ) begins with the company 's primary business strategy to give the reader an overview of the goals of the company 's business . this is followed by a discussion of the critical accounting policies that the company believes are important to understanding the assumptions and judgments incorporated in the company 's reported financial results . the next section , beginning on page 44 , discusses the company 's results of operations for the past two years . beginning on page 49 , the company provides an analysis of its liquidity and capital resources , including discussions of its cash flows , debt arrangements , sources of capital and financial commitments . finally , on page 59 , the company discusses funds from operations , or ffo , which is a non-gaap financial measure of performance of an equity reit used by the reit industry . the md & a should be read in conjunction with the other sections of this annual report on form 10-k , including the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing in item 8 of this report . historical results set forth in selected financial information , the consolidated financial statements and supplemental data included in item 6 and item 8 and this section should not be taken as indicative of the company 's future operations . overview the company 's principal business activity is the ownership , management and development of income-producing properties . the company 's long-term objectives are to increase cash flow from operations and to maximize capital appreciation of its real estate investments . the company 's primary operating strategy is to focus on its community and neighborhood shopping center business and its transit-centric , primarily residential mixed-use properties to achieve both cash flow growth and capital appreciation . management believes there is potential for long term growth in cash flow as existing leases for space in the shopping center and mixed-use properties expire and are renewed , or newly available or vacant space is leased . the company intends to renegotiate leases where possible and seek new tenants for 39 available space in order to optimize the mix of uses to improve foot traffic through the shopping centers . as leases expire , management expects to revise rental rates , lease terms and conditions , relocate existing tenants , reconfigure tenant spaces and introduce new tenants with the goals of increasing occupancy , improving overall retail sales , and ultimately increasing cash flow as economic conditions improve . in those circumstances in which leases are not otherwise expiring , management selectively attempts to increase cash flow through a variety of means , or in connection with renovations or relocations , recapturing leases with below market rents and re-leasing at market rates , as well as replacing financially troubled tenants . when possible , management also will seek to include scheduled increases in base rent , as well as percentage rental provisions , in its leases . the company 's redevelopment and renovation objective is to selectively and opportunistically redevelop and renovate its properties , by replacing below-market-rent leases with strong , traffic-generating anchor stores such as supermarkets and drug stores , as well as other desirable local , regional and national tenants . the company 's strategy remains focused on continuing the operating performance and internal growth of its existing shopping centers , while enhancing this growth with selective acquisitions , redevelopments and renovations . in 2016 , the company completed development of park van ness , a 271 -unit residential project with approximately 9,000 square feet of street-level retail , below street-level structured parking , and amenities including a community room , landscaped courtyards , a fitness room , a wi-fi lounge/business center , and a rooftop pool and deck . the structure comprises 11 levels , five of which on the east side are below street level . because of the change in grade from the street eastward to rock creek park , apartments on all 11 levels have park or city views . the street level retail space is 100 % leased to a grocery/gourmet food market and an upscale italian restaurant . as of december 31 , 2018 , 263 apartments ( 97.0 % ) were leased . the total cost of the project , excluding predevelopment expense and land , which the company has owned , was approximately $ 93.0 million , a portion of which was financed with a $ 71.6 million construction-to-permanent loan . in 2014 , in separate transactions , the company purchased three properties , with approximately 57,400 square feet of retail space , for an aggregate $ 25.2 million . the three properties are adjacent to an existing property on the east side of rockville pike near the twinbrook metro station . combined , the four properties total 10.3 acres and are zoned for up to 1.2 million square feet of rentable mixed-use space . the company is actively engaged in a plan for redevelopment but has not committed to any timetable for commencement of construction . the company owns properties on the east and west sides of rockville pike near the white flint metro station which combined total 7.6 acres which are zoned for a development potential of up to 1.6 million square feet of mixed-use space . the company is actively engaged in a plan for redevelopment but has not committed to any timetable for commencement of construction . in january 2016 , the company terminated a 16,500 square foot lease at 11503 rockville pike and received a $ 3.0 million lease termination fee which was recognized as revenue in the first quarter . story_separator_special_tag this site has mixed-use development potential of up to 325 apartment units and approximately 10,000 square feet of street level retail pursuant to the approved bethesda downtown plan . in december 2018 , the company purchased for $ 4.5 million , including acquisition costs , an interest in an adjacent parcel of land and retail building . the company is evaluating concept plans for the combined property in order to increase the mixed-use development potential by up to 40 additional apartment units . the purchase price was funded through the company 's credit facility . in march 2019 , the company plans to commence development of a pad site expansion on land owned at its lansdowne town center property in ashburn , virginia . total development costs are expected to be approximately $ 4.0 million . a ground lease with chick-fil-a has been executed for one pad with the building to be constructed by the tenant . a lease with starbucks has been executed for another pad and the company will construct the building shell . both buildings are projected to be completed and occupied by early 2020 . 41 in light of the limited amount of quality properties for sale and the escalated pricing of properties that the company has been presented with or has inquired about over the past year , management believes acquisition opportunities for investment in existing and new shopping center and mixed-use properties in the near future is uncertain . because of its conservative capital structure , including its cash and capacity under its revolving credit facility , management believes that the company is positioned to take advantage of additional investment opportunities as attractive properties are identified and market conditions improve . ( see “ item 1. business - capital policies ” ) . it is management 's view that several of the sub-markets in which the company operates have , or are expected to have in the future , attractive supply/demand characteristics . the company will continue to evaluate acquisition , development and redevelopment as integral parts of its overall business plan . the recent period of economic expansion has now run in excess of five years . while economic conditions within the local washington , dc metropolitan area have remained relatively stable , issues facing the federal government relating to taxation , spending and interest rate policy will likely impact the office , retail and residential real estate markets over the coming years . because the majority of the company 's property operating income is produced by our shopping centers , we continually monitor the implications of government policy changes , as well as shifts in consumer demand between on-line and in-store shopping , on future shopping center construction and retailer store expansion plans . based on our observations , we continue to adapt our marketing and merchandising strategies in a way to maximize our future performance . the company 's commercial leasing percentage , on a comparable property basis , which excludes the impact of properties not in operation for the entirety of the comparable periods , increased to 95.7 % at december 31 , 2018 , from 94.3 % at december 31 , 2017 . the company maintains a ratio of total debt to total asset value of under 50 % , which allows the company to obtain additional secured borrowings if necessary . as of december 31 , 2018 , amortizing fixed-rate mortgage debt with staggered maturities from 2019 to 2035 represented approximately 88.2 % of the company 's notes payable , thus minimizing refinancing risk . the company 's variable-rate debt consists of $ 122.0 million outstanding under the credit facility . as of december 31 , 2018 , the company has loan availability of approximately $ 190.7 million under its $ 325.0 million revolving credit facility . on january 4 , 2019 , the company repaid in full the remaining balance of the mortgage loan secured by countryside marketplace , which was scheduled to mature in july 2019. on january 10 , 2019 , the company closed on a 15 -year , non-recourse $ 22.1 million mortgage loan secured by olde forte village . the loan matures in 2034 , bears interest at a fixed-rate of 4.65 % , requires monthly principal and interest payments of $ 124,700 based on a 25 -year amortization schedule and requires a final payment of $ 12.1 million . proceeds were partially used to repay in full the existing mortgage secured by olde forte village , which was scheduled to mature in may 2019. the operating partnership entered into a credit agreement dated january 26 , 2018 , by and among the operating partnership , as borrower , wells fargo bank , national association , as administrative agent , capital one , national association , as syndication agent , wells fargo securities , llc and capital one , national association , as joint lead arrangers , wells fargo securities , llc , as sole bookrunner and wells fargo bank , national association , capital one , n.a. , u.s. bank national association , td bank , n.a. , regions bank and associated bank , national association , as lenders ( the “ new credit agreement ” ) . the new credit agreement consists of a $ 400.0 million credit facility , of which $ 325.0 million is a revolving credit facility and $ 75.0 million is a term loan . the revolving credit facility matures on january 26 , 2022 , and may be extended by the company for one additional year , subject to satisfaction of certain conditions . the term loan matures on january 26 , 2023 , and may not be extended . in general , loan availability under the new facility is primarily determined by operating income from the company 's existing unencumbered properties . interest accrues at a rate of libor plus a spread of 135 basis points to 195 basis points under the revolving credit facility , and 130 basis points to 190 basis points under the term loan , each as determined by certain leverage tests .

management 's view of the financial condition and results of operations of fis and its consolidated subsidiaries as of december 31 , 2014 and 2013 and for the years ended december 31 , 2014 , 2013 and 2012 . this section should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and related notes of fis included elsewhere in this annual report . this management 's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains forward-looking statements . see “ forward-looking statements ” and “ risk factors ” for a discussion of the uncertainties , risks and assumptions associated with these forward-looking statements that could cause future results to differ materially from those reflected in this section . overview fis is a leading global provider of banking and payments technology solutions , and consulting and outsourcing solutions . with a long history deeply rooted in the financial services industry and banking and payment technology solutions , fis delivers services to more than 14,000 institutions in over 100 countries . headquartered in jacksonville , florida , fis employs approximately 40,000 people worldwide and holds leadership positions in payment processing and banking solutions , providing software , services and outsourcing of the technology that drives financial institutions . through our capco brand , we deliver globally a wide range of information technology consulting and transformational services to financial institutions . fis is a member of the fortune 500 u.s. and of standard and poor 's ( s & p ) 500 index . business trends and conditions our revenue is primarily derived from a combination of recurring technology and processing services , consulting and professional services and software license fees . the majority of our revenue has historically been recurring , provided under multi-year contracts that contribute relative stability to our revenue stream . these services , in general , are considered critical to our clients ' operations . a significant portion of these recurring revenues is derived from transaction processing fees that fluctuate with the level of deposit accounts and card transactions associated with consumer and commercial activity . consulting and professional services revenues are typically non-recurring , and sales of software licenses are less predictable , a portion of which can be regarded as discretionary spending by our clients . a continued trend in the financial services industry from which we are benefiting is the migration by many financial institutions to outsourced integrated technology solutions to improve their profitability and rapidly address regulatory challenges . as a provider of outsourcing solutions , we benefit from multi-year recurring revenue streams , which help moderate the effects of year-to-year economic changes on our results of operations . we believe our integrated solutions and outsourced services are targeted and well positioned to address this outsourcing trend across the markets we serve . consulting services revenue grew at an increased pace in 2014 , and we believe this trend will continue in 2015. the current market pressures in the financial services industry are driving demand for our consulting and professional services as many financial institutions seek to transform their businesses to significantly reduce their cost base , innovate , and comply with increased regulatory oversight with regard to information technology and related processes . capco provides strategic consulting service capabilities to respond to these market needs and has established itself as a leading global consultancy focused on transformation strategy and execution . our gross margin percentage will decline if consulting and professional services revenue grows disproportionately to our processing and service revenue , which generally delivers a higher gross margin . in addition , as consulting and professional services revenue grow as a portion of our overall revenue , we likely will have a lower overall percentage of recurring revenue as these services are generally non-recurring . in 2014 , we targeted a market opportunity in large global financial institutions where we coupled our strategic consulting and transformation services with outsourced technology , services and solutions to help them achieve their business goals . we made significant , incremental investments in management , sales and account management resources in 2014 to address this opportunity . we believe this market opportunity remains attractive as these large institutions address the challenges they face , thereby driving demand for our consulting and professional services . additionally , we believe these large global institutions are likely to increase technology spending to meet competitive pressures after a slowdown during the recent financial crisis years . we expect to sustain our 2014 investment in management , sales and account management resources to pursue this market opportunity . story_separator_special_tag a successful cyber-attack on an fis system that resulted in sensitive information being compromised , fraud losses or other adverse consequences could have a material adverse effect on the company . 26 as a multi-regional data processing servicer ( mdps ) , fis continues to be examined by and have regular interaction with the federal agencies that regulate financial institutions . these regulators have the authority to take actions they deem necessary to protect the safety and soundness of the financial institutions they regulate . such actions , if taken , could have a material adverse impact on our business . fis regularly reports to its regulators and to its clients regarding the company 's continual efforts to enhance its information security and risk management technology , programs and procedures . in late april 2014 , the federal agencies that provide regulatory oversight for fis issued a confidential report related to their examination of our information security , risk management and internal audit functions between october 2012 and october 2013. we responded to the report and described the actions that we have taken , as well as ongoing efforts underway to address specific findings . the regulatory agencies distributed the report , and a cover letter , to a subset of our regulated clients beginning in may 2014. this prompted inquiries from clients , which , to the extent permitted by federal regulation , fis has addressed on an individual basis . while individual clients and prospects have expressed concern over the report , we do not believe that it has had a material effect on the overall sales closures in 2014 or our sales pipeline ; however , we continue to monitor sales activity and any potential impact on future periods . we are unable to predict with certainty what , if any , communications or actions our regulators will have or take with our regulated financial institution clients with respect to our risk management and information security . we are also unable to predict the effect that any such communications or actions may have on our business . fis remains focused on making strategic investments in information security to protect its clients and its information systems . this includes both capital expenditures and operating expense on hardware , software , personnel and consulting services . we also participate in industry and governmental initiatives to improve information security for our clients . critical accounting policies the accounting policies described below are those we consider critical in preparing our consolidated financial statements . these policies require management to make estimates , judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures with respect to contingent liabilities and assets at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods . actual amounts could differ from those estimates . see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for a more detailed description of the significant accounting policies that have been followed in preparing our consolidated financial statements . revenue recognition the company generates revenues from the delivery of bank processing , credit and debit card processing services , other payment processing services , professional services , software licensing and software related services . revenues are recognized when evidence of an arrangement exists , delivery has occurred , fees are fixed or determinable and collection is considered probable . we are frequently a party to multiple concurrent contracts with the same client . these situations require judgment to determine whether the individual contracts should be aggregated or evaluated separately for purposes of revenue recognition . in making this determination , we consider the timing of negotiating and executing the contracts , whether the different elements of the contracts are interdependent and whether any of the payment terms of the contracts are interrelated . our individual contracts also frequently include multiple elements . we must apply judgment in these circumstances in determining whether individual elements can be considered separate units of accounting or should instead be accounted for in combination with other deliverables . judgment is also required in ascribing fair value to each deliverable for purposes of allocating consideration . due to the large number , broad nature and average size of individual contracts we are party to , the impact of judgments and assumptions that we apply in recognizing revenue for any single contract is not likely to have a material effect on our consolidated operations or financial position . however , the broader accounting policy assumptions that we apply across similar arrangements or classes of clients could significantly influence the timing and amount of revenue recognized in our historical and future results of operations or financial position . additional information about our revenue recognition policies is included in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements . allowance for doubtful accounts the company analyzes trade accounts receivable by considering historical bad debts , client creditworthiness , current economic trends , changes in client payment terms and collection trends when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts . any change in the assumptions used may result in an additional allowance for doubtful accounts being recognized in the period in which the change occurs . 27 provision for check guarantee losses in our check guarantee business , if a guaranteed check presented to a merchant client is dishonored by the check writer 's bank , we reimburse our merchant client for the check 's face value and pursue collection of the amount from the delinquent check writer . loss provisions and anticipated recoveries are primarily determined by performing a historical analysis of our check loss and recovery experience and considering other factors that could affect that experience in the future . such factors include the general economy , the overall industry mix of our client volumes , statistical analysis of check fraud trends within our client volumes and the quality of returned checks .

follows the provisions of asc 820 , “ fair value measurements and disclosures. ” asc 820 clarifies the definition of fair value , prescribes methods for measuring fair value , and establishes a fair value hierarchy to classify the inputs used in measuring fair value as follows : level 1-observable inputs such as unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities available at the measurement date . level 2-inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability in active markets , quoted prices for identical or similar assets and liabilities in markets that are not active , inputs other than quoted prices that are observable , and inputs derived from or corroborated by observable market data . level 3-inputs are unobservable inputs that reflect management 's assumptions based on the best available information . the carrying value of cash and cash equivalents , prepayments , deposits and other receivables , accruals and other payables , loans from related parties and unrelated party approximate their fair values because of the short-term nature of these instruments . use of estimates the preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with u.s. gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the accompanying consolidated financial statements , and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period . significant estimates required to be made by management include but not limited to , useful lives of property and equipment , intangible assets valuation , inventory valuation and deferred tax assets . actual results could differ from those estimates . deferred offering costs deferred offering costs consisted principally of legal , underwriting and registration costs in connection with the ipo of the company 's ordinary shares . such costs are deferred until the closing of the offering , at which time the deferred costs are offset against the offering proceeds . impairment of long-lived assets the company classifies its long-lived assets into : ( i ) computer and office equipment ; ( ii ) furniture and fixtures , ( iii ) leasehold improvements , and ( iv ) finite – lived intangible assets . long-lived assets held and used by the company are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be fully recoverable . it is possible that these assets could become impaired as a result of technology , economy or other industry changes . if circumstances require a long-lived asset or asset group to be tested for possible impairment , the company first compares undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by that asset or asset group to its carrying value . if the carrying value of the long-lived asset or asset group is not recoverable on an undiscounted cash flow basis , an impairment is recognized to the extent that the carrying value exceeds its fair value . fair value is determined through various valuation techniques , including discounted cash flow models , relief from royalty income approach , quoted market values and third-party independent appraisals , as considered necessary . the company makes various assumptions and estimates regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors in determining the fair values of the respective assets . the assumptions and estimates used to determine future values and remaining useful lives of long-lived assets are complex and subjective . they can be affected by various factors , including external factors such as industry and economic trends , and internal factors such as the company 's business strategy and its forecasts for specific market expansion . 21 revenue recognition the company currently recognizes revenue from the sale of merchandise through its online platforms . revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists ; delivery has occurred or services have been rendered ; the price is fixed or determinable ; and collectability is reasonably assured . revenue was recorded on a gross basis , net of surcharges and value added tax ( `` vat '' ) of gross sales . the company recorded revenue on a gross basis because the company has the following indicators for gross reporting : it is the primary obligor of the sales arrangements , is subject to inventory risks of physical loss , has latitude in establishing prices , has discretion in suppliers ' selection and assumes credit risks on receivables from customers . revenue from advertising is recognized as advertisements are displayed . revenue from software development services comprises revenue from time and material and fixed price contracts . revenue from time and material contracts are recognized as related services are performed . revenue on fixed price contracts is recognized in accordance with percentage of completion method of accounting . foreign currency transactions and translation the reporting currency of the company is united states dollars ( the “ usd ” ) . the functional currency of moxian shenzhen , moyi and moxian beijing is the renminbi ( the “ rmb ” ) . the functional currency of moxian hk is hong kong dollar ( the “ hkd ” ) , and the functional currency of moxian malaysia is malaysia ringgit ( the “ rm ” ) . for financial reporting purposes , the financial statements of moxian shenzhen , moyi , moxian beijing , moxian hk and moxian malaysia , which are prepared using their respective functional currencies , are translated into the reporting currency , united states dollar ( `` u.s. dollar '' ) so to be consolidated with the company 's . monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the reporting currency are translated into the reporting currency at the rates of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date . revenues and expenses are translated using average rates prevailing during the reporting period . adjustments resulting from the translation are recorded as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive loss in stockholders ' deficiency .
","results of operations for the year ended september 30 , 2017 compared with the year ended september 30 , 2016 overview in the year under review , the company 's focus has been to keep upgrading its moxian + app in response to market changes and feedback from the pilot sales campaigns carried out throughout the year . it also made a significant step in integrating its design architecture of the app with that of the china union pay , which is an association of banks in china that provides card services . because of the company 's focus on these technical improvements , as well as the lack of demands in merchant clients ' sales and the advertising space sales , the company was not able to generate the sales it previously anticipated . gross revenues the company had sales of $ 92,205 for the year ended september 30 , 2017 compared to $ 21,479 in the year ended september 30 , 2016 . the slight increase in revenue is the result of the sales of software packages to third parties , coupled with a slight improvement in commissions earned from merchant transactions . operating expenses operating expenses for the years ended september 30 , 2017 and 2016 were $ 13.7 million and $ 13.4 million , respectively . the expenses mainly consisted of depreciation and amortization expenses , research and development ( “ r & d ” ) expenses , advertising agency fee , selling general and administrative expense , impairment charge on intangible assets . 18 depreciation and amortization the depreciation and amortization expenses for the years ended september 30 , 2017 and 2016 was $ 1.1 million and $ 1.8 million , respectively . the depreciation and amortization decreased by $ 0.8 million because a significant impairment charge was made in fiscal year 2016 and intangible assets were fully impaired during fiscal year 2017 due to continuing losses from operations and a deficit in working capital .

markets through toll brothers city living ® ( “ city living ” ) . at october 31 , 2016 , we were operating in 19 states . in the five years ended october 31 , 2016 , we delivered 24,490 homes from 621 communities , including 6,098 homes from 377 communities in fiscal 2016 . in february 2014 , we acquired the home building business of shapell industries , inc. , a delaware corporation ( “ shapell ” ) , and in november 2016 , we acquired substantially all of the assets and operations of coleman real estate holdings , llc ( “ coleman ” ) . see “ acquisitions ” below for more information . we are developing several land parcels for master planned communities in which we intend to build homes on a portion of the lots and sell the remaining lots to other builders . two of these master planned communities are being developed 100 % by us , and the remaining communities are being developed through joint ventures with other builders or financial partners . in addition to our residential for-sale business , we also develop and operate for-rent apartments through joint ventures . see the section entitled “ toll brothers apartment living/toll brothers campus living/toll brothers realty trust ” below . we operate our own land development , architectural , engineering , mortgage , title , landscaping , security monitoring , lumber distribution , house component assembly , and

october 31 , 2014 . customer mortgage financing we maintain relationships with a widely diversified group of mortgage financial institutions , many of which are among the largest in the industry . we believe that regional and community banks continue to recognize the long-term value in creating relationships with high-quality , affluent customers such as our home buyers , and these banks continue to provide such customers with financing . we believe that our home buyers generally are , and should continue to be , better able to secure mortgages due to their typically lower loan-to-value ratios and attractive credit profiles , as compared to the average home buyer . toll brothers apartment living/toll brothers campus living/toll brothers realty trust in addition to our residential for-sale business , we also develop and operate for-rent apartments through joint ventures . at october 31 , 2016 , we controlled 28 land parcels as for-rent apartment projects containing approximately 9,600 units . these projects , which are located in the metro boston to metro washington , d.c. corridor ; atlanta , georgia ; dallas , texas ; and fremont , california are being operated , are being developed or will be developed with partners under the brand names toll brothers apartment living , toll brothers campus living and toll brothers realty trust ( the “ trust ” ) . at october 31 , 2016 , we had approximately 2,950 units in for-rent apartment projects that were occupied or ready for occupancy , 600 units in the lease-up stage , 900 units under active development , and 5,150 units in the planning stage . of the 9,600 units at october 31 , 2016 , 4,850 were owned by joint ventures in which we have an interest ; approximately 1,600 were owned by us ; 2,850 were under contract to be purchased by us ; and 300 were under a letter of intent . story_separator_special_tag and ( v ) alternative uses for the property , such as the possibility of a sale of the entire community to another builder or the sale of individual home sites . future communities : we evaluate all land held for future communities or future sections of operating communities , whether owned or optioned , to determine whether or not we expect to proceed with the development of the land as originally contemplated . this evaluation encompasses the same types of estimates used for operating communities described above , as well as an evaluation of the regulatory environment in which the land is located and the estimated probability of obtaining the necessary approvals , the estimated time and cost it will take to obtain those approvals , and the possible concessions that will be required to be given in order to obtain them . concessions may include cash payments to fund improvements to public places such as parks and streets , dedication of a portion of the property for use by the public or as open space , or a reduction in the density or size of the homes to be built . based upon this review , we decide ( i ) as to land under contract to be purchased , whether the contract will likely be terminated or renegotiated , and ( ii ) as to land we own , whether the land will likely be 25 developed as contemplated or in an alternative manner , or should be sold . we then further determine whether costs that have been capitalized to the community are recoverable or should be written off . the write-off is charged to cost of revenues in the period in which the need for the write-off is determined . the estimates used in the determination of the estimated cash flows and fair value of both current and future communities are based on factors known to us at the time such estimates are made and our expectations of future operations and economic conditions . should the estimates or expectations used in determining estimated fair value deteriorate in the future , we may be required to recognize additional impairment charges and write-offs related to current and future communities and such amounts could be material . we provided for inventory impairment charges and the expensing of costs that we believed not to be recoverable in each of the three fiscal years ended october 31 , 2016 , 2015 , and 2014 , as shown in the table below ( amounts in thousands ) : replace_table_token_13_th the table below provides , for the periods indicated , the number of operating communities that we reviewed for potential impairment , the number of operating communities in which we recognized impairment charges , the amount of impairment charges recognized , and , as of the end of the period indicated , the fair value of those communities , net of impairment charges ( $ amounts in thousands ) : replace_table_token_14_th income taxes — valuation allowance significant judgment is applied in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets . in accordance with gaap , a valuation allowance is established against a deferred tax asset if , based on the available evidence , it is more likely than not that such asset will not be realized . the realization of a deferred tax asset ultimately depends on the existence of sufficient taxable income in either the carryback or carryforward periods under tax law . we assess the need for valuation allowances for deferred tax assets 26 based on gaap 's “ more-likely-than-not ” realization threshold criteria . in our assessment , appropriate consideration is given to all positive and negative evidence related to the realization of the deferred tax assets . forming a conclusion that a valuation allowance is not needed is difficult when there is significant negative evidence such as cumulative losses in recent years . this assessment considers , among other matters , the nature , consistency , and magnitude of current and cumulative income and losses , forecasts of future profitability , the duration of statutory carryback or carryforward periods , our experience with operating loss and tax credit carryforwards being used before expiration , and tax planning alternatives . our assessment of the need for a valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets includes assessing the likely future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our consolidated financial statements or tax returns . changes in existing tax laws or rates could affect our actual tax results , and our future business results may affect the amount of our deferred tax liabilities or the valuation of our deferred tax assets over time . our accounting for deferred tax assets represents our best estimate of future events . due to uncertainties in the estimation process , particularly with respect to changes in facts and circumstances in future reporting periods ( carryforward period assumptions ) , actual results could differ from the estimates used in our analysis . our assumptions require significant judgment because the residential home building industry is cyclical and is highly sensitive to changes in economic conditions . if our results of operations are less than projected and there is insufficient objectively verifiable positive evidence to support the more-likely-than-not realization of our deferred tax assets , a valuation allowance would be required to reduce or eliminate our deferred tax assets . our deferred tax assets consist principally of the recognition of losses primarily driven by accrued expenses , inventory impairments , and impairments of investments in unconsolidated entities . in accordance with gaap , we assess whether a valuation allowance should be established based on our determination of whether it was more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets would not be realized . at october 31 , 2016 and 2015 , we determined that it was more-likely-than-not that our deferred assets would be realized for federal purposes . accordingly , at october 31 , 2016 and 2015 , we did not record any valuation allowances against our federal deferred tax assets .

"the information in this section has been derived from the consolidated financial statements and footnotes thereto , which are included in item 8 of this form 10-k. you should read the information in this section in conjunction with the business and financial information regarding us as provided in this form 10-k. overview our principal business consists of attracting deposits from the general public and investing those funds , along with borrowed funds in loans secured by first and second mortgages on one-to-four family residences , including home equity loans and construction and land/lot loans , commercial real estate loans , construction and development loans , commercial and industrial loans , indirect automobile loans , and municipal leases . municipal leases are secured primarily by a ground lease for a firehouse or an equipment lease for fire trucks and firefighting equipment to fire departments located throughout north and south carolina . we also purchase investment securities consisting primarily of securities issued by united states government agencies and government-sponsored enterprises , as well as , commercial paper and certificates of deposit insured by the fdic . we offer a variety of deposit accounts for individuals , businesses , and nonprofit organizations . deposits and borrowings are our primary source of funds for our lending and investing activities . we are significantly affected by prevailing economic conditions , as well as , government policies and regulations concerning , among other things , monetary and fiscal affairs , housing and financial institutions . deposit flows are influenced by a number of factors , including interest rates paid on competing time deposits , other investments , account maturities , and the overall level of personal income and savings . lending activities are influenced by the demand for funds , the number and quality of lenders , and regional economic cycles . our primary source of pre-tax income is net interest income . net interest income is the difference between interest income , which is the income that we earn on our loans and investments , and interest expense , which is the interest that we pay on our deposits and borrowings . changes in levels of interest rates affect our net interest income . a secondary source of income is noninterest income , which includes revenue we receive from providing products and services , including service charges on deposit accounts , mortgage banking income , and gains and losses from sales of securities . an offset to net interest income is the provision for loan losses which is required to establish the allowance for loan losses at a level that adequately provides for probable losses inherent in our loan portfolio . as a loan 's risk rating improves , property values increase , or recoveries of amounts previously charged off are received , a recapture of previously recognized provision for loan losses may be added to net interest income . our noninterest expenses consist primarily of salaries and employee benefits , expenses for occupancy , marketing and computer services , and fdic deposit insurance premiums . salaries and benefits consist primarily of the salaries and wages paid to our employees , payroll taxes , expenses for retirement and other employee benefits . occupancy expenses , which are the fixed and variable costs of buildings and equipment , consist primarily of lease payments , property taxes , depreciation charges , maintenance and costs of utilities . 52 in recent years , we have expanded our geographic footprint into six additional markets through strategic acquisitions as well as three de novo commercial loan offices . looking forward , we believe opportunities currently exist within our market areas to grow our franchise . we anticipate organic growth as the local economy and loan demand strengthens , through our marketing efforts and as a result of the opportunities being created as a result of the consolidation of financial institutions occurring in our market areas . we may also seek to expand our franchise through the selective acquisition of individual branches , loan purchases and , to a lesser degree , whole bank transactions that meet our investment and market objectives . we will continue to be disciplined as it pertains to future expansion focusing primarily on organic growth in our current market areas . at june 30 , 2017 , we had 42 locations in north carolina ( including the asheville metropolitan area , the `` piedmont '' region , charlotte , and a loan production office in raleigh ) , upstate south carolina ( greenville ) , east tennessee ( including kingsport/johnson city/bristol , knoxville , and morristown ) and southwest virginia ( including the roanoke valley ) . merger , acquisition , and consolidation activity on january 1 , 2017 , the company completed its acquisition of trisummit pursuant to an agreement and plan of merger , dated as of september 20 , 2016 , under which trisummit merged with and into hometrust with hometrust as the surviving corporation in the merger . immediately following the merger , trisummit 's wholly owned subsidiary bank , trisummit bank , merged with and into the bank . trisummit had seven offices throughout the east tennessee market . the acquisition added approximately $ 258.0 million in loans and $ 280.0 million in deposits . on december 31 , 2016 , the bank acquired united financial of north carolina , inc. ( `` united financial '' ) , a municipal lease company headquartered in fletcher , north carolina that specializes in providing financing for fire departments and municipalities for the purchase of fire trucks and related equipment as well as the construction of fire stations and other municipal buildings across the carolinas and other southeastern states . united financial underwrites and originates these municipal leases and then sells them to hometrust and other financial institutions . beginning january 1 , 2017 , united financial has conducted business under the name united financial , a division of hometrust bank . on october 30 , 2015 , the bank consolidated six branch offices located in north carolina and tennessee . story_separator_special_tag we believe opportunities currently exist within our new market areas to grow our franchise as illustrated by 88 % of our commercial loan originations in fiscal year 2017 were originated by commercial relationship managers located in market areas we entered into subsequent to our conversion . we anticipate organic growth as the local economy and loan demand strengthens , through our marketing efforts and as a result of the opportunities being created as a result of the consolidation of financial institutions occurring in our market areas . we may also seek to expand our franchise through the selective acquisition of individual branches , loan purchases and , to a lesser degree , whole bank transactions that meet our investment and market objectives . we will continue to be disciplined as it pertains to future expansion focusing primarily on organic growth in our current market areas . maintaining and improving asset quality . the company believes that strong asset quality is a key to long-term financial success . the percentage of nonperforming loans to total loans was 0.58 % and 1.01 % for june 30 , 2017 and 2016 , respectively . the company 's percentage of nonperforming assets to total assets at june 30 , 2017 was 0.62 % compared to 0.90 % at june 30 , 2016. the company has actively managed the delinquent loans and nonperforming assets by aggressively pursuing the collection of consumer debts and marketing saleable properties upon foreclosure or repossession , work-outs of classified assets and loan charge-offs . in the past several years , the company has applied more conservative and stringent underwriting practices to new loans , including , among other things , an increased emphasis on a borrower 's ongoing ability to repay a loan by requiring lower debt to income ratios , higher credit scores and lower loan to value ratios than our previous lending policies had required . although the company intends to grow the commercial loan portfolio by expanding commercial real estate and commercial and industrial lending , the company intends to manage credit exposures through the use of experienced bankers in this area and a conservative approach to lending . emphasizing lower cost core deposits to manage the funding costs of our loan growth . we offer personal checking , savings and money-market accounts , which generally are lower-cost sources of funds than certificates of deposit and are less sensitive to withdrawal when interest rates fluctuate . to build our core deposit base , over the past several years , we have sought to reduce our dependence on traditional higher cost deposits in favor of stable lower cost demand deposits . we have utilized additional product offerings , technology and a focus on customer service in working toward this goal . in addition , we intend to increase demand deposits by growing business banking relationships through a recently expanded product line tailored to our target business customers ' needs . we are also pursuing a number of strategies that include enhancing our online and mobile banking platform , including improvements to online account opening and sales promotions on money market and checking accounts to encourage the growth of lower cost deposits . improving profitability through customer growth and balance sheet management . we are continuing to focus significant efforts on creating brand awareness , offering competitive products and employing a strong and experienced workforce . in order to deepen the relationships with our customers and increase individual customer profitability , we have continued our cross-marketing program , which allows us to better identify lending opportunities and services for customers when a new account is opened . in addition , we have targeted our direct mail campaigns to take advantage of competitor mergers and or branch closures to acquire new customer core deposits . we believe these initiatives have positioned us well to implement a strategy focused on improving revenue growth and noninterest income . hiring and retaining experienced employees with a customer service focus . we have been successful in attracting and retaining banking professionals with strong community relationships and significant knowledge of our markets , through both individual hires and business combinations , which is central to our business strategy . exceptional service , local involvement and timely decision-making are integral parts of our business strategy , and we continue to seek additional highly qualified and motivated individuals . we believe that by focusing on experienced bankers who are established in their communities , we enhance our market position and add profitable growth opportunities . our compensation and incentive systems are aligned with our strategies to grow core deposits and our loan portfolio as the economy improves , while improving asset quality . we have a strong corporate culture based on personal accountability , high ethical standards and significant training opportunities , which is supported by our commitment to career development and promotion from within the organization . 54 critical accounting policies certain of our accounting policies are important to the portrayal of our financial condition , since they require management to make difficult , complex or subjective judgments , some of which may relate to matters that are inherently uncertain . estimates associated with these policies are susceptible to material changes as a result of changes in facts and circumstances . facts and circumstances which could affect these judgments include , but are not limited to , changes in interest rates , changes in the performance of the economy and changes in the financial condition of borrowers . on april 5 , 2012 , the jobs act was signed into law . the jobs act contains provisions that , among other things , reduce certain reporting requirements for qualifying public companies . as an “ emerging growth company ” we may delay adoption of new or revised accounting pronouncements applicable to public companies until such pronouncements are made applicable to private companies . we intend to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period , although we have not done so to date .
","general . total assets increased $ 488.9 million , or 18.0 % to $ 3.2 billion at june 30 , 2017 from $ 2.7 billion at june 30 , 2016. this increase was largely due to the trisummit acquisition which closed on january 1 , 2017. net loans receivable increased $ 518.8 million , or 28.6 % at june 30 , 2017 to $ 2.3 billion from $ 1.8 billion at june 30 , 2016 , primarily due to $ 258.1 million in loans acquired from trisummit , $ 242.5 million in net organic loan growth , and $ 18.1 million in purchased helocs , net of repayments . the increase in borrowings of $ 205.5 million , or 41.9 % and the cumulative decrease of $ 74.8 million , or 16.9 % in cash and cash equivalents , commercial paper and certificates of deposit in other banks during fiscal 2017 were mainly used to fund the trisummit acquisition , higher yielding loan originations , and purchases of helocs . the $ 9.9 million increase in other investments at cost was a result of additional fhlb stock purchases as required to support additional fhlb borrowings . we continue to utilize our leveraging strategy , where additional short-term fhlb borrowings are invested in various short-term liquid assets to generate additional net interest income , as well as increased dividend income from the required purchase of additional fhlb stock . the cumulative increase of $ 31.8 million , or 15.3 % in premises and equipment , deferred income taxes , bank-owned life insurance , goodwill , and core deposit intangibles were all a direct result of the trisummit acquisition . cash , cash equivalents , and commercial paper .

's common stock and preferred stock . we currently intend to limit our indebtedness to 60 % of our total enterprise value and , based on the closing price of digital realty trust , inc. common stock on december 31 , 2012 of $ 67.89 , our ratio of debt to total enterprise value was approximately 32 % as of december 31 , 2012. our total enterprise value is defined as the sum of the market value of digital realty trust , inc.

developable land . these properties are mainly located throughout the u.s. , with 21 properties located in europe , three properties in australia , one property in asia and one property in canada . story_separator_special_tag if our lenders are not able to meet their funding commitments to us , our business , results of operations , cash flows and financial condition could be adversely affected . if we do not have sufficient cash flow to continue operating our business and are unable to borrow additional funds , access our existing lines of credit or raise equity or debt capital , we may need to source alternative ways to increase our liquidity . such alternatives may include , without limitation , curtailing development activity , disposing of one or more of our properties possibly on disadvantageous terms or entering into or renewing leases on less favorable terms than we otherwise would . 55 rental income . the amount of rental income generated by the properties in our portfolio depends on several factors , including our ability to maintain or improve the occupancy rates of currently leased space and to lease currently available space and space available from lease terminations . excluding 2.4 million square feet of space held for development , as of december 31 , 2012 , the occupancy rate of the properties in our portfolio was approximately 94.4 % of our net rentable square feet . as of december 31 , 2012 , we had 2,016 leases with a total of 595 tenants . as of december 31 , 2012 , approximately 82 % of our leases ( on a rentable square footage basis ) contained base rent escalations that were either fixed ( generally ranging from 2 % to 4 % ) or indexed based on a consumer price index or other similar inflation related index . we can not assure you that these escalations will cover any increases in our costs or will otherwise keep rental rates at or above market rates . the amount of rental income generated by us also depends on our ability to maintain or increase rental rates at our properties . included in our approximately 19.5 million net rentable square feet , excluding space held for development , at december 31 , 2012 is approximately 390,000 net rentable square feet of space with extensive datacenter improvements that is currently , or will shortly be , available for lease . since our ipo , we have leased approximately 3,115,000 square feet of similar space . these turn-key flex sm facilities are effective solutions for tenants who prefer to utilize a partner with the expertise or capital budget to provide extensive datacenter infrastructure and security . our expertise in datacenter construction and operations enables us to lease space to these tenants at a premium over other uses . in addition , as of december 31 , 2012 , we had approximately 2.4 million square feet of space held for development , or approximately 10 % of the total rentable space in our portfolio , including four vacant properties comprising approximately 624,000 square feet . our ability to grow earnings depends in part on our ability to develop space and lease development space at favorable rates , which we may not be able to obtain . development space requires significant capital investment in order to develop datacenter facilities that are ready for use and , in addition , we may require additional time or encounter delays in securing tenants for development space . we may purchase additional vacant properties and properties with vacant development space in the future . we will require additional capital to finance our development activities , which may not be available or may not be available on terms acceptable to us , including as a result of the conditions described above under global market and economic conditions. economic downturns , including as a result of the conditions described above under global market and economic conditions ,  or regional downturns affecting our markets or downturns in the technology-related real estate industry that impair our ability to lease or renew or re-lease space , or otherwise reduce returns on our investments or the ability of our tenants to fulfill their lease commitments , as in the case of tenant bankruptcies , could adversely affect our ability to maintain or increase rental rates at our properties . scheduled lease expirations . our ability to re-lease expiring space at rental rates equal to or in excess of current rental rates will impact our results of operations . in addition to approximately 1.1 million square feet of available space in our portfolio , which excludes approximately 2.4 million square feet of space held for development as of december 31 , 2012 , leases representing approximately 4.0 % and 7.2 % of the net rentable square footage of our portfolio are scheduled to expire during the years ending december 31 , 2013 and 2014 , respectively . 56 during the year ended december 31 , 2012 , we signed new leases totaling approximately 878,000 square feet of space and renewal leases totaling approximately 833,000 square feet of space . the following table summarizes our leasing activity in

"this asu , entitled `` reconsideration of effective control for repurchase agreements `` , amends one of three criteria used to determine whether or not a transfer of assets may be treated as a sale by the transferor . under topic 860 , story_separator_special_tag introduction the following is management 's discussion and analysis of the significant changes in the financial condition , results of operations , capital resources , and liquidity presented in its accompanying consolidated financial statements for acnb corporation ( the corporation or acnb ) , a financial holding company . please read this discussion in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and disclosures included herein . current performance does not guarantee , assure or indicate similar performance in the future . critical accounting policies the accounting policies that the corporation 's management deems to be most important to the portrayal of its financial condition and results of operations , and that require management 's most difficult , subjective or complex judgment , often result in the need to make estimates about the effect of such matters which are inherently uncertain . the following policies are deemed to be critical accounting policies by management : the allowance for loan losses represents management 's estimate of probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio . management makes numerous assumptions , estimates and adjustments in determining an adequate allowance . the corporation assesses the level of potential loss associated with its loan portfolio and provides for that exposure through an allowance for loan losses . the allowance is established through a provision for loan losses charged to earnings . the allowance is an estimate of the losses inherent in the loan portfolio as of the end of each reporting period . the corporation assesses the adequacy of its allowance on a quarterly basis . the specific methodologies applied on a consistent basis are discussed in greater detail under the caption , allowance for loan losses , in a subsequent section of this management 's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations . the evaluation of securities for other-than-temporary impairment requires a significant amount of judgment . in estimating other-than-temporary impairment losses , management considers various factors including the length of time the fair value has been below cost , the financial condition of the issuer , and the corporation 's intent to sell , or requirement to sell , the securities before recovery of its value . declines in fair value that are determined to be other than temporary are charged against earnings . accounting standards codification ( asc ) topic 350 , intangiblesgoodwill and other , requires that goodwill is not amortized to expense , but rather that it be tested for impairment at least annually . impairment write-downs are charged to results of operations in the period in which the impairment is determined . the corporation did not identify any impairment on its outstanding goodwill from its most recent testing , which was performed as of december 31 , 2011. if certain events occur which might indicate goodwill has been impaired , the goodwill is tested when such events occur . other acquired intangible assets with finite lives , such as customer lists , are required to be amortized over the estimated lives . these intangibles are generally amortized using the straight line method over estimated useful lives of ten years . executive overview the primary source of the corporation 's revenues is net interest income derived from interest earned on loans and investments , less deposit and borrowing funding costs . revenues are influenced by general economic factors , including market interest rates , the economy of the markets served , stock market conditions , as well as competitive forces within the markets . 29 the corporation 's overall strategy is to increase loan growth in local markets , while maintaining a reasonable funding base by offering competitive deposit products and services . the year 2011 continued to be challenging for many financial institutions with high levels of problem assets , recession in the housing markets , lingering high unemployment , and slow uneven growth . acnb continued to be profitable and well capitalized despite expenses elevated from the aftershocks of this epic challenge to the united states economy . lower provision for loan losses , which is still quite high by historic levels , and continued careful spending resulted in increased net income to $ 8,502,000 , or $ 1.43 per share , in 2011 , compared to $ 8,419,000 , or $ 1.42 per share , in 2010 and $ 7,219,000 , or $ 1.22 per share , in 2009. returns on average equity were 8.80 % , 9.15 % and 8.34 % in 2011 , 2010 and 2009 , respectively . because funding costs were near practical floors , they could not be decreased at the same rate of earning assets decreases , therefore the corporation 's net interest margin decreased from 2010 on average to 3.74 % in 2011 , compared to 3.92 % and 3.64 % in 2010 and 2009 , respectively . net interest income was $ 34,370,000 in 2011 , as compared to $ 35,017,000 in 2010 and $ 32,252,000 in 2009. other income was $ 11,737,000 , $ 12,172,000 and $ 11,703,000 in 2011 , 2010 and 2009 , respectively . the largest source of other income is commissions from insurance sales from russell insurance group , inc. ( rig ) , which decreased by 3 % in 2011 with the effects of lower premium insurance and reduced commercial insurance volume due to economic contractions . in 2011 , a $ 1,000 net gain was recognized on investments compared to net gains of $ 72,000 in 2010 and $ 17,000 in 2009. in 2009 , the corporation took an impairment charge of $ 522,000 on two equity securities that were determined to be other-than-temporarily impaired ; no impairment charges occurred in either 2010 or 2011. income from fiduciary activities totaled $ 1,396,000 for 2011 , as compared to $ 1,303,000 for 2010 and $ 1,057,000 for 2009. story_separator_special_tag goodwill that has an indefinite useful life is evaluated for impairment annually and is evaluated for impairment more frequently if events and circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired . that annual assessment date is december 31. an impairment loss is recognized to the extent that the carrying amount exceeds the asset 's fair value . the goodwill impairment analysis is a two-step test . the first step , used to identify potential impairment , involves comparing each reporting unit 's estimated fair value to its carrying value , including goodwill . if the estimated fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value , goodwill is considered not to be impaired . if the carrying value exceeds estimated fair value , there is an indication of potential impairment and the second step is performed to measure the amount of impairment . if required , the second step involves calculating an implied fair value of goodwill for the reporting unit for which the first step indicated potential impairment . the implied fair value of goodwill is determined in a manner similar to the amount of goodwill calculated in a business combination , by measuring the excess of the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to a group of likely buyers whose cash flow estimates could differ from those of the reporting entity , as determined in the first step , over the aggregate estimated fair values of the individual assets , liabilities and identifiable intangibles as if the reporting unit was being acquired in a business combination . if the implied fair value of goodwill exceeds the carrying value of goodwill assigned to the reporting unit , there is no impairment . if the carrying value of goodwill assigned to a reporting unit exceeds the implied fair value 34 of the goodwill , an impairment charge is recorded for the excess . subsequent reversal of goodwill impairment losses is not permitted . acnb performs an annual evaluation to determine if there is goodwill impairment . as noted above , commissions from insurance sales decreased 3 % although rig 's stand alone net income increased by 50 % in 2011 compared to 2010 boosted by expense savings and elimination of management fees to the holding company . as the testing for potential impairment involves methods that include both current and projected income amounts , the fair value increased at december 31 , 2011 , as compared to previous years ' impairment testing results . the results of the annual evaluations determined that there was no impairment of goodwill , including the testing at december 31 , 2011. however , future declines in rig 's net income or changes in external market factors , including likely buyers that are assumed in impairment testing , may require an impairment charge to goodwill . a liability incurred at december 31 , 2011 , for contingent consideration owed on previous purchases of additional insurance books of business , did not unfavorably impact the fair value of rig . the liability for further contingent consideration incurred was $ 338,000 compared to a maximum aggregate liability of $ 1,800,000 on two purchases that had a contingent consideration measurement date at december 31 , 2011. the actual liability was lower than the potential maximum aggregate liability due to the uncertainties in retaining books of business in the current economic cycle . should it be determined in a future period that the goodwill has been impaired , then a charge to earnings will be recorded in the period that such a determination is made . other expenses other expenses decreased 1 % to $ 30,016,000 for the year ended december 31 , 2011. the largest component of other expenses is salaries and employee benefits , which fell 1 % to $ 17,138,000 compared to $ 17,318,000 in 2010. the reasons for the decrease in salaries and employee benefits expenses include the following : decreased defined benefit pension expense due to prior year plan investment performance and the reduced benefit formula implemented by the corporation on january 1 , 2010 , stable other benefit plan costs , particularly medical insurance , and lower production-based commissions and incentives , offset by increases from higher employee usage of 401 ( k ) plan benefits including the employer match and compliance cost , and payroll taxes , normal merit increases to employees , and an increase in the number of full-time equivalent employees . salaries and employee benefits decreased $ 362,000 or 2 % from 2009 to 2010. the decreased expense was due primarily to a significantly lower defined benefit pension expense in 2010 from better return on plan assets in 2009 after the severe downturn in return in 2008. the corporation reduced the benefit formula for the defined benefit pension plan effective january 1 , 2010 , in order to manage total benefit costs . the corporation 's overall investment strategy is to achieve a mix of investments to meet the long-term rate of return assumption and near-term pension obligations with a diversification of asset types , fund strategies , and fund managers . the mix of investments is adjusted periodically by retaining an advisory firm to recommend appropriate allocations after reviewing the corporation 's risk tolerance on contribution levels , funded status , plan expense , as well as any applicable regulatory requirements . however , the determination of future benefit expense is also dependent on the fair value of assets and the discount rate on the year-end measurement date ; specifically , with low discount rates and fair value volatility , the expense will be negatively impacted in 2012 by the historically low rates at the latest measurement date and very low plan return in 2011 .
","results of operations net interest income the primary source of acnb 's traditional banking revenue is net interest income , which represents the difference between interest income on earning assets and interest expense on liabilities used to fund those assets . earning assets include loans , securities , and interest bearing deposits with banks . interest bearing liabilities include deposits and borrowings . net interest income is affected by changes in interest rates , volume of interest bearing assets and liabilities , and the composition of those assets and liabilities . the `` interest rate spread '' and `` net interest margin '' are two common statistics related to changes in net interest income . the interest rate spread represents the difference between the yields earned on interest earning assets and the rates paid for interest bearing liabilities . the net interest margin is defined as the percentage of net interest 30 income to average earning assets , which also considers the corporation 's net non-interest bearing funding sources , the largest of which are non-interest bearing demand deposits and stockholders ' equity . the following table includes average balances , rates , interest income and expense , interest rate spread , and net interest margin : table 1average balances , rates and interest income and expense replace_table_token_5_th for yield calculation purposes , nonaccruing loans are included in average loan balances . loan fees of $ 48,000 , $ 52,000 and $ 90,000 as of december 31 , 2011 , 2010 and 2009 , respectively , are included in interest income . yields on tax-exempt securities are not tax effected .

"pass-through surcharges for resin ; and ( 4 ) higher sales for our engineered components products , due largely to higher demand from a national customer . in connection with our european operations , we expanded our plant in germany to a third production line which became operational in 2013. we expect demand for our warm-edge spacers to remain high in europe , but to be more challenged in north america , as sales of our higher-end spacer products continue to be negatively affected by the housing downturn in canada and the recent shift in new construction to multi-family dwellings in the united states . our cost of sales increased by $ 64.2 million , or 18 % , when comparing fiscal 2013 to fiscal 2012. this increase was slightly higher than the 16 % increase in net sales for the respective period . of this increase in cost of sales , $ 43.0 million was related to the alumco acquisition . in addition , we have experienced pricing pressure , as well as higher material and labor costs . the profitability of our vinyl products continues to be challenged as we have provided volume discounts for our fastest growing customers and experienced an increase in the cost of resin , which is the primary raw material used to manufacture our vinyl profiles . as sales to certain customers increase , we are obligated to provide greater price concessions in the form of volume discounts , which ultimately reduce our profit margins . we were able to pass some of the higher resin costs on to our customers through price adjustments , but we did absorb a greater proportion of this expense during recent months , as reflected in the decline in overall profit margin year-over-year . as our business grows and throughput increases , we must retain quality workers by providing higher wages , more overtime pay and supplemental indirect labor . to offset these cost increases , we are focused on improving our 28 operational and production efficiencies to lower overall manufacturing overhead costs , although we remain challenged in certain areas , including managing our scrap costs . an increase in material costs has adversely affected our current year gross margins . we completed a plan to consolidate our insulating glass spacer facilities in north america in august 2012. partially offsetting our increase in cost of sales was consolidation savings in fiscal 2013 totaling $ 4.7 million . our selling , general and administrative costs decreased by $ 8.5 million , or 13 % , when comparing fiscal 2013 and fiscal 2012. during fiscal 2012 , we incurred $ 8.0 million of insulating glass consolidation related expenses that did not recur during the current period . in addition , we estimate annual pre-tax savings as a result of this consolidation of $ 4.0 million . these decreases in selling , general and administration expense were partially offset by the expense associated with alumco , which contributed $ 3.4 million during fiscal 2013. depreciation and amortization expense increased by $ 3.3 million , or 12 % , when comparing fiscal 2013 to fiscal 2012. of this amount , $ 2.8 million was related to certain intangible assets and fixed assets we acquired with the alumco purchase transaction . in addition , we have invested approximately $ 17.7 million for capital improvements during the twelve months ended october 31 , 2013 , which has resulted in additional depreciation expense compared to fiscal 2012. we recorded an impairment loss of $ 1.5 million during fiscal 2013. of this amount , $ 0.7 million was related to a write-down of certain land held for sale in arizona , and $ 0.8 million was related to a write-down of the facility held for sale in barbourville , kentucky , as well as certain other fixed assets of our insulating glass business . for fiscal 2012 , we recorded an impairment loss of $ 0.9 million associated with our facility in barbourville , kentucky . aluminum sheet products replace_table_token_9_th net sales for our aluminum sheet products business segment increased by $ 48.1 million , or 13 % in fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012. the primary driver of this increase in sales was an increase in the volume of pounds shipped of 17 % during this period . the benefit received from the volume increase was partially offset by lower aluminum prices , evidenced by lower-than-expected lme pricing . based on published reports , lme aluminum pricing per pound decreased 7 % during fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012. furthermore , we have experienced a continued shift in our business from value-added painted sheet to mill finished products , which command a lower sales price and less favorable profit margins . we resolved a labor strike during the second quarter of 2012 which we estimate reduced our shipments by approximately 12 million pounds in fiscal 2012. cost of sales increased by 9 % in fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012. the changes in cost of sales were consistent with the percent changes in net sales for these periods , except margins were more favorable in 2013. as a result of the strike that occurred during 2012 , we incurred higher third-party processing ( labor ) and material costs as we purchased semi-finished coil from outside parties to fulfill customer orders , as we did not have the labor necessary to run our casting facility at full capacity . in 2013 , we did not incur these outside service costs . however , our operations were unfavorably impacted by the volatility of aluminum commodity prices . we continue to focus on operating efficiencies to improve our margins . we emphasize quality service to our customers and preventive maintenance to yield positive results for our aluminum sheet products business segment . we invested heavily in

"since many diseases are caused by the inappropriate activity of specific genes , the ability to silence genes selectively through rnai could provide a new way to treat a wide range of human diseases . we believe that drugs that work through rnai have the potential to become a broad new class of drugs , like small molecule , protein and antibody drugs . using our intellectual property and the expertise we have built in rnai , we are developing a set of biological and chemical methods and know-how that we apply in a systematic way to develop rnai therapeutics for a variety of diseases . our core product strategy was launched in january 2011 and is focused on the development and commercialization of novel rnai therapeutics as genetic medicines . under our core product strategy , we expect to have six to seven genetic medicine product candidates in clinical development , including at least two programs in phase 3 and five to six programs with human proof of concept , by the end of 2015. we are currently advancing the following core programs in clinical or pre-clinical development : patisiran , for the treatment of attr in patients with fap ; aln-ttrsc , for the treatment of attr in patients with ttr cardiac amyloidosis , including fac and ssa ; aln-at3 , for the treatment of hemophilia and rbd ; aln-cc5 , for the treatment of complement-mediated diseases ; aln-as1 , for the treatment of hepatic porphyrias , including aip ; aln-pcssc , for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia ; aln-aat , for the treatment of aat deficiency liver disease ; aln-tmp , for the treatment of beta-thalassemia and iron-overload disorders ; aln-ang , for the treatment of genetic forms of mixed hyperlipidemia and severe hypertriglyceridemia ; and other yet to be disclosed programs . our strategy is to retain development and commercial rights for our current and future genetic medicine pipeline in north america and western europe , while forming alliances with leading , innovative companies for the development and commercialization of these products in the row . in early 2014 , we formed an alliance with genzyme to develop and commercialize our current and future genetic medicine pipeline principally in territories outside of north america and western europe , subject to certain broader rights . in january 2014 , we entered into a stock purchase agreement with sirna , merck and , for limited purposes , merck & co. , inc. , pursuant to which we will purchase from merck all of merck 's right , title and interest in and to all of the outstanding shares of common stock of sirna . sirna possesses intellectual property and rnai assets including pre-clinical therapeutic candidates , chemistry , and sirna-conjugate and other delivery technologies that we intend to integrate into our platform for delivery of rnai therapeutics . we will not acquire any employees , manufacturing or other facilities , developed processes or clinical-stage assets as part of the acquisition of sirna . in consideration for the sirna common stock , we will ( i ) pay merck $ 25.0 million in cash and ( ii ) issue to merck 2,520,044 shares of our common stock , having a value of $ 150.0 million as calculated under the terms of the stock purchase agreement on the date of execution . following the closing of this transaction , merck will beneficially own approximately 4 % of our outstanding common stock . in addition , merck is eligible to receive the following consideration from us : ( i ) up to an aggregate of $ 10.0 million upon the achievement by us or our related parties of specified regulatory milestones for rnai products covered by sirna intellectual property , and ( ii ) up to an aggregate of $ 105.0 million upon the achievement by us or our related parties of specified development and regulatory ( $ 40.0 million ) and commercial ( $ 65.0 million ) milestones associated with the clinical development progress of certain pre-clinical candidates discovered by sirna , together with low single-digit royalties for our products and single-digit royalties for sirna products , in each case based on annual worldwide net sales , if any , by us and our related parties of any such products . the stock purchase agreement contains customary representations , warranties , and covenants of the parties thereto . subject to customary closing conditions , including the expiration or early termination of the applicable pre-merger waiting period under the hart-scott-rodino antitrust improvements act of 1976 , the transaction is expected to close during the first quarter of 2014 . 80 in addition , in january 2014 , we entered into a global , strategic collaboration with genzyme to discover , develop and commercialize rnai therapeutics as genetic medicines to treat orphan diseases . the 2014 genzyme collaboration is governed by a master collaboration agreement , including the license terms appended thereto , which will become effective upon closing of the equity transaction , described below . once effective , the master agreement will supersede and replace the 2012 genzyme agreement , which original genzyme agreement is described under the heading strategic alliances in our annual report on form 10-k for the year ended december 31 , 2012. the 2014 genzyme collaboration is structured as an exclusive relationship for the worldwide development and commercialization of rnai therapeutics in the field of genetic medicines , which includes our current and future genetic medicine programs that reach human pop by the end of 2019 , subject to extension to the end of 2021 in various circumstances . we will retain product rights in north america and western europe , while genzyme will obtain exclusive rights to develop and commercialize collaboration products in the genzyme territory , together with certain broader co-development/co-promote or worldwide rights for certain products . genzyme 's rights are structured as an opt-in that is triggered upon achievement of human pop . story_separator_special_tag in addition , we continue to work internally and with third-party collaborators to develop and optimize new technologies to deliver our rnai therapeutics both directly to specific sites of disease , and systemically by intravenous or subcutaneous administration . there is a risk that any drug discovery or development program may not produce revenue for a variety of reasons , including the possibility that we will not be able to adequately demonstrate the safety and efficacy of the product candidate . moreover , there are uncertainties specific to any new field of drug discovery , including rnai . the successful development of any product candidate we develop is highly uncertain . due to the numerous risks associated with developing drugs , we can not reasonably estimate or know the nature , timing and estimated costs of the efforts necessary to complete the development of , or the period , if any , in which material net cash inflows will commence from , any potential product candidate . these risks include the uncertainty of : our ability to discover new product candidates ; our ability to progress

on our operations , financial position and liquidity . a discussion of some of the risks and uncertainties associated with completing our projects on schedule , or at all , and the potential consequences of failing to do so , are set forth in part i , item 1a of this annual report on form 10-k under the heading risk factors. strategic alliances a significant component of our business plan is to enter into strategic alliances and collaborations with leading pharmaceutical and life sciences companies , academic institutions , research foundations and others , as appropriate , to gain access to funding , capabilities , technical resources and intellectual property to further our development efforts and to generate revenues . we also seek to form or advance new ventures and opportunities in areas outside our primary focus on rnai therapeutics . to generate revenues from our intellectual property rights , we also grant licenses to biotechnology companies under our interferx program for the development and commercialization of rnai therapeutics for specified targets in which we have no direct strategic interest . we also license key aspects of our intellectual property to companies active in the research products and services market , which includes the manufacture and sale of reagents . we expect our interferx and research product licenses to generate modest near-term revenues that we can re-invest in the development of our proprietary rnai therapeutics pipeline . at january 31 , 2014 , we had granted such licenses , on both an exclusive and non-exclusive basis , to approximately 20 companies . since delivery of rnai therapeutics remains an important objective of our research activities , we also look to form collaboration and licensing arrangements with other companies and academic institutions to gain access to delivery technologies . for example , we have entered into agreements with arrowhead , tekmira , mit , ubc and acuitas , among others , to focus on various delivery strategies . we have also entered into license agreements with isis , max planck innovation , tekmira , mit , crt and whitehead , as well as a number of other entities , to obtain rights to intellectual property in the field of rnai . finally , we have sought , and may seek in the future , funding for the development of our proprietary rnai therapeutics pipeline from the government and foundations . critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements , which have been prepared in accordance with gaap . the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets , liabilities , revenues and expenses and disclosure of contingent liabilities in our consolidated financial statements . actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions and could have a material impact on our reported results .
","results of operations the following data summarizes the results of our operations for the periods indicated , in thousands : replace_table_token_5_th the increase in operating expenses for the year ended december 31 , 2012 resulted from a $ 65.0 million charge to operating expenses in connection with the restructuring of our license agreement with tekmira in november 2012 , which is described below under the heading restructuring of tekmira licensing agreement. we expect to record a significant charge to operating expenses in connection with our acquisition of sirna , which we expect to close in the first quarter of 2014. the expected total amount of this expense will be based on a cash payment of $ 25.0 million and a charge for the value of the 2,520,044 shares of common stock we issue to merck , multiplied by the closing price of our common stock at the closing of the transaction . discussion of results of operations for 2013 and 2012 net revenues from collaborators we generate revenues through research and development collaborations . the following table summarizes our total consolidated net revenues from collaborators , for the periods indicated , in thousands : replace_table_token_6_th 93 net revenues from collaborators decreased for the year ended december 31 , 2013 as compared to the year ended december 31 , 2012 due primarily to the completion of our remaining performance obligations under the roche/arrowhead alliance in august 2012. this decrease was partially offset by recognition of the remaining deferred revenue under the cubist agreement of $ 9.7 million due to the termination of the cubist agreement in february 2013 and the end of our performance obligations thereunder . in addition , the decrease was partially offset by revenues recorded under our agreements with monsanto and mdco .

"factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include , but are not limited to , those identified below and those discussed in the section titled “ risk factors ” included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k. overview we are an immuno-oncology company developing tumor-specific cancer immunotherapies to fight multiple cancer types . our approach harnesses the natural power of a patient 's own immune system to recognize short tumor-specific peptide sequences presented on cancer cells , referred to as tumor-specific neoantigens , or tsna , in order to destroy tumor cells . our tumor-specific immunotherapy programs are built on two key pillars—first , our proprietary gritstone edge artificial intelligence platform which enables us to identify tsna with high accuracy ; and second , a potent immunotherapy platform which we have engineered to deliver the selected tsna and drive the patient 's immune system to attack and destroy tumors . we initiated a first-in-human phase 1/2 clinical trial of granite , our first personalized immunotherapy product candidate , in the fourth quarter of 2018 , evaluating it in the treatment of multiple common solid tumors , , in each case in combination with checkpoint inhibitors provided by our collaborator , bristol-myers squibb company , or bms . we dosed our first patient in this trial , go-004 , in the first quarter of 2019. the phase 1 portion of the go-004 phase 1/2 trial will seek to establish a dose for further investigation in phase 2 and to evaluate safety , tolerability and , importantly , immunogenicity of our product candidate . we will seek to further evaluate efficacy and safety in the phase 2 cohort expansion portion in several common solid tumor types . our second tumor-specific product candidate series , slate , utilizes the same antigen delivery system as granite but contains a fixed cassette with tsna that are shared across a subset of cancer patients rather than a cassette unique to an individual patient , providing us with an off-the-shelf alternative to our personalized manufactured product candidate , granite . the u.s. food and drug administration , or fda , allowed the investigational new drug application , or ind , for slate to proceed in june 2019 and we have initiated a phase 1/2 clinical trial of slate , go-005 , in combination with immune checkpoint inhibitors for the treatment of patients with advanced solid tumors , including metastatic non-small cell lung cancer , pancreatic cancer and colorectal cancer . we dosed our first patient in this trial , go-005 , in the third quarter of 2019. we are developing a second immunotherapy platform targeting shared tumor antigens , including shared tsna , which relies upon bispecific antibodies , or bisab , targeting solid tumors . bisab have been shown by others to exhibit early evidence of efficacy in b cell malignancies , using b cell-specific targets such as cd19 , cd20 , cd22 and bcma , and our goal is to extend this concept into the treatment of solid tumors using our novel approach to identify tumor-specific antigens and antibody fragments against such targets . our bisab approach uses an antibody fragment to recognize a tumor antigen and , in the same molecule , a different antibody fragment to recognize immune effector cells such as cd3+ t cells . these therapeutics aim to refocus immune effector cells specifically upon the tumor through antibody-driven recognition of tumor-specific antigens . we use our edge platform to identify novel solid tumor-specific antigens and develop antibody fragments that bind tightly and with high specificity to these targets . these antibody fragments are deployed within a bispecific antibody framework to form novel “ drug-in-a-bottle ” therapeutic candidates . we expect this program to generate a development candidate in the second half of 2020. we have funded our operations to date primarily from private placements of our convertible preferred stock , the net proceeds from our initial public offering , or ipo , which we completed in october 2018 , from our follow-on public offering , which we completed in april 2019 , and from our at the marketing offering , as well as cash proceeds from bluebird under the collaboration agreement we entered into in august 2018 , or the bluebird bio , inc. , or bluebird , collaboration agreement . we do not expect to generate revenue from any product candidates that we develop until we obtain regulatory approval for one or more of such product candidates and commercialize our products or enter into collaboration agreements with third parties . substantially all of our net losses have resulted from costs incurred in connection with our research and development programs and from general and administrative costs associated with our operations . our slate , granite and bisab programs will require substantial additional development time and resources before we would be able to apply for or receive regulatory approvals and begin generating revenue from product sales . in addition , we expect to incur additional costs associated with operating as a public company . we also do not yet have a sales organization or commercial infrastructure and , accordingly , we will incur significant expenses to develop a sales organization or commercial infrastructure in advance of generating any commercial product sales . as a result , we will need substantial additional capital to support our operating activities . 92 we currently anticipate that we will seek to fund our operations through equity or debt financings or other sources , such as potential collaboration agreements with third parties . adequate funding may not be available to us on acceptable terms , or at all . if sufficient funds on acceptable terms are not available when needed , we will be required to significantly reduce our operating expenses and delay , reduce the scope of , or eliminate one or more of our development programs . story_separator_special_tag certain terms of the agreement were modified by amendment in july 2018. under the agreement , arbutus grants us a worldwide , exclusive license to certain technology of arbutus , including arbutus ' portfolio of proprietary and clinically validated lnp products and associated intellectual property , as well as technology transfer of arbutus ' manufacturing know-how . under this agreement , we made an upfront payment of $ 5.0 million , which was included in research and development expenses during the year ended december 31 , 2017. following the acceptance of our investigational new drug application for granite by the u.s. food and drug administration , we made a $ 2.5 million development milestone payment to arbutus in september 2018 that was recorded as research and development expense . during the years ended december 31 , 2019 and 2018 , we reimbursed arbutus for materials and personnel costs totaling $ 0.4 million and $ 0.4 million , respectively . in august 2019 , a milestone was met following the initial patient treatment of slate in our go-005 clinical trial . we recorded $ 3.0 million as research and development expense in connection with the milestone . the milestone payment was made in october 2019. see “ business—license and collaborations—license agreement with arbutus biopharma corporation ” for additional information . we expect our research and development expenses to increase substantially in the future as we advance our cancer immunotherapy candidates into and through clinical studies and pursue regulatory approval . conducting the necessary clinical studies to obtain regulatory approval is costly and time-consuming and such clinical studies generally become larger and more costly to conduct as they advance into later stages . the successful development of our product candidates is highly uncertain . the actual probability of success for our product candidates may be affected by a variety of risks and uncertainties associated with drug development , including those set forth in the section entitled “ risk factors ” included in part i , section 1a and elsewhere in this report . due to the early-stage nature of our cancer immunotherapy programs , we do not track costs on a project-by-project basis . 94 general and administrative expenses our general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related costs , including payroll taxes , benefits , non-cash stock-based compensation and travel . other general and administrative expenses include legal costs of pursuing patent protection of our intellectual property , and professional service fees for auditing , tax and general legal services . we expect our general and administrative expenses to continue to increase in the future as we expand our operating activities and prepare for potential commercialization of our current and future product candidates , increase our headcount and support our operations as a public company , including increased expenses related to legal , accounting , regulatory and tax-related services associated with maintaining compliance with requirements of the nasdaq global select market and the sec , directors and officers liability insurance premiums and investor relations activities . allocated expenses consist of rent expenses related to our office and research and development facilities , depreciation and other allocated costs not otherwise included in research and development expenses . interest income , net interest income , net , consists primarily of interest income and investment income earned on our cash , cash equivalents and marketable securities , and for 2018 , interest expense on our lease financing obligation , which was derecognized on january 1 , 2019 in connection with our adoption of accounting standards update no . 2016-02 , leases ( “ topic 842 ” ) . story_separator_special_tag for the year ended december 31 , 2017. the increase of $ 5.7 million was primarily attributable to a $ 2.7 million increase in personnel 96 related costs as we expanded our headcount , and a $ 2.3 million increase in outside services for legal , finance , recruiting and other professional services to support our ongoing operations . facility related expenses increased by $ 0.7 million to accommodate our increased general and administrative headcount . interest income , net interest income was $ 0.8 million for the year ended december 31 , 2018 compared to interest income of $ 0.4 million for the year ended december 31 , 2017. the increase of $ 0.4 million was due to a higher average cash , cash equivalents and marketable securities balance in 2018 than in 2017 , partially offset by increased interest expense incurred on our lease financing obligation . liquidity and capital resources sources of liquidity from our inception through december 31 , 2019 , we have funded our operations primarily through private placements of our convertible preferred stock , our collaboration agreement with bluebird , and the proceeds from the sale of our common stock in our ipo , follow on public offering , and at the market offering . we have raised net cash proceeds of $ 177.9 million from the issuance of our convertible preferred stock and a non-refundable upfront payment of $ 20.0 million from bluebird . in october 2018 , we completed our initial public offering by issuing 6,854,202 shares of our common stock , including 187,535 shares sold pursuant to the underwriters ' partial exercise of their option to purchase additional shares , at an offering price of $ 15.00 per share , for net proceeds of approximately $ 92.5 million , after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering costs . in april 2019 , we completed an underwritten public offering and sold and issued an aggregate of 6,500,000 shares of common stock at a price to the public of $ 11.50 per share . we received aggregate net proceeds from the offering of approximately $ 69.7 million , after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering costs .
","results of operations comparison of the years ended december 31 , 2019 and 2018 the following table sets forth the significant components of our results of operations ( in thousands ) : replace_table_token_5_th collaboration revenue collaboration revenue was $ 4.4 million and $ 1.2 million for the years ended december 31 , 2019 and 2018 , respectively . the $ 3.2 million increase was due to an entire year of revenue recognized in 2019 pursuant to the bluebird collaboration agreement which we entered into in august 2018. research and development expenses research and development expenses were $ 82.9 million for the year ended december 31 , 2019 compared to $ 55.0 million for the year ended december 31 , 2018. the increase of $ 27.9 million for the year ended december 31 , 2019 was primarily due to increases in personnel related expenses , expenses related to outside services and consultants , in-house laboratory supplies and consumables and facilities expenses . personnel related costs increased by $ 7.9 million , as a direct result of our increased research and development headcount . outside services and consultants increased by $ 7.5 million for clinical trials , preclinical testing and contract manufacturing expansion . in-house expenses for laboratory supplies and consumables increased by $ 6.0 million , and reflect our increased research and development personnel . facility related expenses increased by $ 6.0 million to accommodate our manufacturing expansion and increased research and development personnel . milestone and license payments increased by $ 0.5 million reflecting a $ 2.5 million payment made in 2018 and a $ 3.0 million payment made in 2019 under a certain agreement upon the achievement of certain milestones .

"npas are now at their lowest level since june 30 , 2008 · strong results from the frb 's 2012 ccar process , which resulted in a 25 % increase to the quarterly dividend in 2012 and a 15 % increase to the quarterly dividend in the first quarter of 2013. highlights of the stress test results include : o one of the strongest tier 1 common ratios ( excluding capital issuances ) among traditional banks o lowest loan loss rate under the stress scenario among traditional banks · total end of period loans held for investment increased 6.6 % driven by growth in the residential mortgage , commercial and industrial , other lending subsidiaries and direct retail lending portfolios · continued improvement in deposit mix and average cost , as evidenced by a 26.4 % increase in noninterest-bearing deposits , and a 25 basis point reduction in the average cost of interest-bearing deposits , during 2012 · successful acquisition of crump insurance in april 2012 resulted in bb & t establishing a # 1 market share in wholesale life and a # 2 market share in wholesale property and casualty in u.s. markets · successful acquisition of bankatlantic in july 2012 , which enhanced bb & t 's presence in the southeast florida market and resulted in a $ 3.5 billion increase in deposits challenges bb & t 's business has become more dynamic and complex in recent years . consequently , management has annually evaluated and , as necessary , adjusted the company 's business strategy in the context of the current operating environment . during this process , management considers the current financial condition and performance of the company and its expectations for future economic activity from both a national and local market perspective . the achievement of bb & t 's key strategic objectives and established long-term financial goals is subject to many uncertainties and challenges . in the opinion of management , the challenges that are most relevant and likely to have a near term impact on performance are presented below : · the impact of u.s. fiscal debt , budget and tax negotiations · intense competition within the financial services industry · cost and risk associated with the regulatory initiatives overview of significant events and financial results despite challenging market conditions throughout the year , bb & t produced record annual earnings for 2012. these results were driven by broad-based loan growth , improvements in deposit mix and cost , a significant increase in noninterest income , and a continued focus on controlling noninterest expense . in addition , bb & t continued to make significant progress towards reducing the level of npas , which had a beneficial impact on credit costs incurred during the year . 30 consolidated net income available to common shareholders for 2012 totaled $ 1.9 billion , an increase of $ 627 million , or 48.6 % , compared to $ 1.3 billion earned during 2011. on a diluted per common share basis , earnings for 2012 were $ 2.70 , compared to $ 1.83 for 2011. bb & t 's results of operations for 2012 produced a return on average assets of 1.14 % and a return on average common shareholders ' equity of 10.35 % compared to prior year ratios of 0.82 % and 7.49 % , respectively . bb & t 's revenues for 2012 were $ 9.8 billion on a fte basis , up 12.1 % compared to 2011. the increase in revenues was broad based , with $ 350 million of the increase attributable to higher net interest income and $ 707 million related to an increase in noninterest income . net interest income on a fte basis was up 6.2 % compared to 2011 , primarily the result of a 23.1 % decrease in interest expense compared to 2011. noninterest income increased 22.7 % compared to 2011 , largely the result of record insurance , mortgage banking and investment banking and brokerage commission revenues . credit costs continued to improve during 2012 as npas , excluding covered foreclosed property , declined $ 914 million , or 37.3 % , compared to 2011. this decline included a $ 492 million decrease in npls and a $ 422 million decrease in foreclosed real estate and other property . net charge-offs for 2012 , excluding covered , were $ 1.3 billion , a decrease of $ 334 million , or 21.0 % , compared to the prior year . bb & t recorded a $ 1.0 billion provision for credit losses in 2012 , excluding covered , compared to $ 1.1 billion in the prior year . the ratio of the alll to net charge-offs excluding covered was 1.50x for 2012 compared to 1.32x in 2011. foreclosed property expenses declined $ 536 million , or 66.8 % , during 2012 , reflecting the impact of a more aggressive approach to reducing the inventory of foreclosed property that was implemented during the fourth quarter of 2011. bb & t 's total assets at december 31 , 2012 were $ 183.9 billion , an increase of $ 9.3 billion , or 5.3 % , compared to december 31 , 2011. the growth in total assets includes an increase of $ 7.2 billion in total loans and leases and $ 2.3 billion in the total securities portfolio . the growth in the loan and lease portfolio reflects broad-based growth , led by increases in the residential mortgage , commercial and industrial and direct retail lending portfolios . the increase in the total securities portfolio is primarily the result of purchases of investment securities that were made in the fourth quarter of 2012 in response to slowing loan growth forecasts . total deposits at december 31 , 2012 were $ 133.1 billion , an increase of $ 8.1 billion , or 6.5 % , from december 31 , 2011. the increase in deposits was led by noninterest-bearing deposits , which increased $ 6.8 billion , or 26.4 % , and money market and savings accounts , which increased $ 3.3 billion , or 7.4 % . story_separator_special_tag fair value measurements are derived from market-based pricing matrices that were developed using observable inputs that include benchmark yields , benchmark securities , reported trades , offers , bids , issuer spreads and broker quotes . management performs various procedures to evaluate the accuracy of the fair values provided by the third-party service . these procedures , which are performed independent of the responsible lob , include comparison of pricing information received from the third party pricing service to other third party pricing sources , review of additional information provided by the third party pricing service and other third party sources for selected securities , and back-testing to compare the price realized on any security sales to the daily pricing information received from the third party pricing service . the ipv committee , which provides oversight to bb & t 's enterprise-wide ipv function , is responsible for oversight of the comparison of pricing information received from the third party pricing service to other third party pricing sources , approving tolerance limits determined by ipv for price comparison exceptions , reviewing significant changes to pricing and valuation policies , and reviewing and approving the pricing decisions made on any illiquid and hard-to-price securities . when market observable data is not available , which generally occurs due to the lack of liquidity for certain securities , the valuation of the security is subjective and may involve substantial judgment by management . as of december 31 , 2012 , bb & t had approximately $ 994 million of available for sale securities , which is less than 1 % of total assets , valued using unobservable inputs , the majority of which were non-agency rmbs securities that are covered by a loss sharing agreement with the fdic . bb & t periodically reviews available-for-sale securities with an unrealized loss . an unrealized loss exists when the current fair value of an individual security is less than its amortized cost basis . the purpose of the review is to consider the length of time and the extent to which the market value of a security has been below its amortized cost . the primary factors bb & t considers in determining whether an impairment is other-than-temporary are long-term expectations and recent experience regarding principal and interest payments , and bb & t 's intent to sell and whether it is more likely than not that the company would be required to sell those securities before the anticipated recovery of the amortized cost basis . 32 msrs bb & t has a significant mortgage loan servicing portfolio and related msrs . bb & t has two classes of msrs for which it separately manages the economic risk : residential and commercial . residential msrs are primarily carried at fair value with changes in fair value recorded as a component of mortgage banking income . bb & t uses various derivative instruments to mitigate the income statement effect of changes in fair value due to changes in valuation inputs and assumptions of its residential msrs . msrs do not trade in an active , open market with readily observable prices . while sales of msrs do occur , the precise terms and conditions typically are not readily available . accordingly , bb & t estimates the fair value of residential msrs using an oas valuation model to project msr cash flows over multiple interest rate scenarios , which are then discounted at risk-adjusted rates . the oas model considers portfolio characteristics , contractually specified servicing fees , prepayment assumptions , delinquency rates , late charges , other ancillary revenue , costs to service and other economic factors . bb & t reassesses and periodically adjusts the underlying inputs and assumptions in the oas model to reflect market conditions and assumptions that a market participant would consider in valuing the msr asset . fair value estimates and assumptions are compared to industry surveys , recent market activity , actual portfolio experience and , when available , observable market data . due to the nature of the valuation inputs , msrs are classified within level 3 of the valuation hierarchy . the value of msrs is significantly affected by mortgage interest rates available in the marketplace , which influence mortgage loan prepayment speeds . in general , during periods of declining interest rates , the value of msrs declines due to increasing prepayments attributable to increased mortgage-refinance activity . conversely , during periods of rising interest rates , the value of msrs generally increases due to reduced refinance activity . commercial msrs are carried at the lower of cost or market and amortized over the estimated period that servicing income is expected to be received based on projections of the amount and timing of estimated future cash flows . the amount and timing of servicing asset amortization is based on actual results and updated projections . refer to note 7 “ loan servicing ” in the “ notes to consolidated financial statements ” for quantitative disclosures reflecting the effect that changes in management 's assumptions would have on the fair value of msrs . lhfs bb & t originates certain mortgage loans for sale to investors that are carried at fair value . the fair value is primarily based on quoted market prices for securities backed by similar types of loans . changes in the fair value are recorded as a component of mortgage banking income , while the related origination costs are recognized in noninterest expense when incurred . the changes in fair value of these assets are largely driven by changes in interest rates subsequent to loan funding and changes in the fair value of servicing associated with the mortgage loan held for sale . bb & t uses various derivative instruments to mitigate the economic effect of changes in fair value of the underlying loans . derivative assets and liabilities bb & t uses derivatives to manage various financial risks . the fair values of derivative financial instruments are determined based on quoted market prices , dealer quotes and internal pricing models that are primarily sensitive to market observable data .
","fourth quarter results consolidated net income available to common shareholders for the fourth quarter of 2012 totaling $ 506 million was up 29.4 % compared to $ 391 million earned during the same period in 2011. on a diluted per common share basis , earnings for the fourth quarter of 2012 were $ 0.71 , up 29.1 % compared to $ 0.55 for the same period in 2011. bb & t 's results of operations for the fourth quarter of 2012 produced an annualized return on average assets of 1.20 % and an annualized return on average common shareholders ' equity of 10.51 % compared to prior year ratios of 0.93 % and 8.76 % , respectively . total revenues were $ 2.5 billion for the fourth quarter of 2012 , up $ 122 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2011. the increase in total revenues included $ 24 million of higher taxable-equivalent net interest income , which was primarily driven by a 21.4 % decrease in funding costs from the same quarter of the prior year . nim was 3.84 % , down 18 basis points compared to the fourth quarter of 2011 , which reflects covered loan run-off and lower yields on new loans and securities partially offset by lower funding costs . noninterest income increased $ 98 million , primarily attributable to a $ 108 million increase in insurance income and a $ 96 million increase in mortgage banking income , offset by a $ 103 million decrease in net securities gains .

's discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon its consolidated financial statements , which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states . the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets , liabilities , revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities . several of the company 's accounting policies involve significant judgments , uncertainties and estimates . the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances , the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities . actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions . to the extent that actual results differ from management 's judgments and estimates , there could be a material adverse effect on the company . on a continuous basis , the company evaluates its estimates , including , but not limited to , those estimates related to its allowance for doubtful accounts , inventory reserves , and valuation allowance for the deferred tax assets relating to its net operating loss carry forwards ( “ nols ” ) , goodwill and intangible assets and commitments and contingencies . with respect to accounts receivable , the company estimates the necessary allowance for doubtful accounts based on both historical and anticipated trends of payment history and the ability of the customer to fulfill its obligations . for inventory , the company evaluates both current and anticipated sales prices of its products to determine if a write down of inventory to net realizable value is necessary . in determining the company 's valuation allowance for its deferred tax assets , the company assesses its ability to generate taxable income in the future . goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired in business combinations accounted for under the purchase method of accounting . the company tests for any impairment of goodwill annually . intangibles with determinable lives are amortized over the estimated useful lives of the assets currently ranging from 2 to 13 years . the company reviews these useful lives annually to determine that they reflect future realizable value . the company utilizes both internal and external sources to evaluate potential current and future liabilities for various commitments and contingencies . in the event that the assumptions or conditions change in the future , the estimates could differ from the original estimates . 16 overview sales of refrigerants continue to represent a significant majority of the company 's revenues . the company 's refrigerant sales are primarily hcfc and hfc based refrigerants and to a lesser extent cfc based refrigerants that are no longer manufactured . currently the company purchases virgin hcfc and hfc refrigerants and reclaimable hcfc , hfc and cfc

"if the company determines that the useful life of its property , plant and equipment or its identified intangible assets should be changed , the company would depreciate or amortize the net book value in excess of the salvage value over its revised remaining useful life , thereby increasing or decreasing depreciation or amortization expense . long-lived assets , including property , plant and equipment and other intangibles , are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable . such impairment tests are based on a comparison of undiscounted cash flows to the recorded value of the asset . the estimate of cash flow is based upon , among other things , assumptions about expected future operating performance . the company 's estimates of undiscounted cash flow may differ from actual cash flow due to , among other things , technological changes , economic conditions , changes to its business model or changes in its operating performance . if the sum of the undiscounted cash flows ( excluding interest ) is less than the carrying value , the company recognizes an impairment loss , measured as the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the asset . the company did not identify any long-lived assets of its continuing operations as being impaired during 2013 story_separator_special_tag overview we are a global leader in infrastructure protection and maintenance , providing proprietary technologies and services : ( i ) to protect against the corrosion of industrial pipelines ; ( ii ) to rehabilitate and strengthen water , wastewater , energy and mining piping systems and buildings , bridges , tunnels and waterfront structures ; and ( iii ) to utilize integrated professional services in engineering , procurement , construction , maintenance and turnaround services for a broad range of energy related industries . our business activities include manufacturing , distribution , maintenance , construction , installation , coating and insulation , cathodic protection , research and development and licensing . our acquisition of brinderson , l.p. and related entities ( “ brinderson ” ) on july 1 , 2013 opens new markets for us through the maintenance , engineering and construction services for downstream and upstream facilities in the north american oil and gas market . our products and services are currently utilized and performed in more than 80 countries across six continents . we believe that the depth and breadth of our products and services platform make us a leading “ one-stop ” provider for the world 's infrastructure rehabilitation and protection needs . we are organized into four reportable segments : energy and mining ; north american water and wastewater ; international water and wastewater ; and commercial and structural . we regularly review and evaluate our reportable segments . market changes between the segments are typically independent of each other , unless a macroeconomic event affects the water and wastewater rehabilitation markets , the oil , mining and gas markets and the commercial and structural markets concurrently . these changes exist for a variety of reasons , including , but not limited to , local economic conditions , weather-related issues and levels of government funding . our long-term strategy consists of : expanding our position in the growing and profitable energy and mining sector through organic growth , selective acquisitions of companies , formation of strategic alliances and by conducting complimentary product and technology acquisitions ; capitalizing on energy and mining opportunities afforded by “ nested ” customer relationships — fostering growth across our subsidiaries , increasing cross selling opportunities and generating a greater stream of recurring revenues , thereby reducing project volatility ; optimizing our water and wastewater rehabilitation operations by : ( i ) improving project execution , cost management practices , including the reduction of redundant fixed costs , and product mix ; ( ii ) identifying opportunities to streamline key management functions and processes to improve our profitability ; and ( iii ) strongly emphasizing higher return manufacturing operations ; growing market opportunities in the commercial and structural infrastructure sector through : ( i ) continued customer acceptance of current products and technologies ; ( ii ) expansion of our product and service offerings with respect to protection , rehabilitation and restoration of a broader group of infrastructure assets ; and ( iii ) leveraging our premier brand and experience of successfully innovating and delivering technologies and services through selective acquisitions of companies and technologies and through strategic alliances ; and expanding all of our businesses in key emerging markets such as asia and the middle east . see “ financial statements and supplementary data ” in item 8 of this report for further discussion regarding our recent acquisitions and strategic initiatives . 34 results of operations 2013 compared to 2012 replace_table_token_4_th consolidated income from continuing operations decreased $ 6.6 million , or 11.2 % , to $ 52.0 million in 2013 compared to $ 58.6 million in 2012. the decrease was attributable to declines in our energy and mining and commercial and structural segments due to ( i ) weak market conditions for our coatings business in new iberia , louisiana , supporting the gulf of mexico ; ( ii ) weak market conditions in certain international markets for our industrial linings business , notably mexico and south america ; and ( iii ) a stall in sales activities and project performance issues for our north american commercial and structural business due to the departure in late 2012 of several key leaders in sales and operations . also contributing to the decrease was a $ 2.7 million increase in acquisition-related expenses incurred in 2013 and the $ 5.8 million pre-tax difference in earnout reversals between the two periods . story_separator_special_tag our water and wastewater segment 's operating expenses declined due to continued cost containment efforts and organizational improvements that were implemented in the second half of 2011. total contract backlog was $ 533.2 million at december 31 , 2012 compared to $ 461.6 million at december 31 , 2011. the december 31 , 2012 level included $ 36.6 million of backlog from our 2012 acquisitions of fyfe asia and fyfe la . our north american water and wastewater segment increased backlog by $ 55.0 million , or 42.3 % , year over year from increased market activity and several large project wins during 2012 . 36 story_separator_special_tag coating operations in new iberia , louisiana that was not present during 2013. the industrial lining work in morocco generated negative gross margins in 2013 and declined $ 8.7 million compared to 2012 , while gross profit on the coating operations in new iberia , louisiana declined $ 6.9 million , or 94.0 % . in addition , gross profit from our robotic coating operations decreased $ 3.6 million , or 30.3 % , due to customer-directed delays on the wasit project and other projects being moved into 2014. partially offsetting these declines were improved results from our industrial linings operations in the middle east , which increased gross profit $ 4.0 million during 2013. we believe the end markets for our energy and mining segment remain robust . project delays and timing of project activity for the coating operations in the gulf of mexico and lining operations in some international markets slowed momentum in 2013. for the first half of 2014 , we expect ( i ) a pick up in production of the large robotic project for the offshore wasit gas field ; ( ii ) growth from our cathodic protection operations , specifically in canada , from capital investments in north america and growth in new geographies for engineered pipeline integrity systems ; ( iii ) higher margins for the projects expected to be completed in our industrial lining operations with the completion of the lower margin morocco project ; and ( iv ) increased contributions from brinderson due to expected strong maintenance work from recent awards , coupled with the impact of a full year contribution to earnings ( business was acquired in july 2013 ) . we anticipate continued healthy global markets in the near term will lead to expansion within existing geographies for our corrosion engineering and industrial lining platforms as well as new geographies , specifically in asia and the middle east . we believe that continued strong commodity prices coupled with ever increasing demand for pipeline maintenance spending in the sector , more significant opportunities in deep water offshore pipeline development , particularly in the gulf of mexico , along with growth in our businesses situated in the key infrastructure spend areas of canada , the middle east and south america , provide us significant growth opportunities well into the future . the outlook for brinderson also is very robust with recent new awards for the western region of the united states upstream and downstream oil and gas markets . in addition , brinderson is pursuing opportunities to expand its services in the west texas permian basin region and other high growth geographies . during 2012 , our energy and mining segment gross profit increased by $ 18.3 million , or 16.7 % , to $ 127.6 million compared to $ 109.3 million in 2011 ; however , our gross margins declined by 120 basis points during 2012. our gross profit increased across all product lines with the largest increases coming from a $ 5.2 million , or 16.6 % , increase in our industrial lining operations and an $ 8.5 million , or 257.5 % , increase from a full year of results in our robotic coating operation . we experienced a 310 basis point margin decline in our industrial lining operations , due to the growth of international markets , which historically have lower margins , and a 270 basis point margin decline in our coating operations from a larger mix of more commodity type coating projects . operating expenses operating expenses in our energy and mining segment increased by $ 10.0 million , or 12.9 % , in 2013 compared to 2012. brinderson added $ 11.4 million of operating expenses during the second half of 2013 and the operating expenses from our industrial lining operations increased $ 1.8 million , or 20.6 % , during 2013 due to international expansion and to provide additional project support to the moroccan project . offsetting these increases were declines from improved cost efficiencies in our cathodic protection and robotics coating operations . as a percentage of revenues , our energy and mining operating expenses were 15.5 % and 15.0 % in 2013 and 2012 , respectively . during 2012 , operating expenses in our energy and mining segment increased by $ 5.9 million , or 8.3 % , compared to 2011. the primary driver for the increase in operating expenses was additional project management and administrative personnel in the united states and the middle east to support the significant geographic expansion of this business . additionally , this segment included $ 3.2 million and $ 0.6 million of additional operating expenses from a full year of operations of crts and hockway , respectively . as a percentage of revenues , our energy and mining operating expenses were 15.0 % for 2012 compared to 17.0 % for 2011 due to healthy top line growth and resulting coverage leverage . operating income and operating margin during 2013 , we reversed $ 3.9 million of the contractual earnouts related to crts because operating results were below the stated threshold amounts in the purchase agreement , mostly due to delays we have experienced with the wasit project in saudi arabia . in addition , 2013 results also included $ 5.8 million for costs incurred related to the company 's acquisition of brinderson and other acquisition targets .

"for results of operations discussions related to years ending december 31 , 2019 and 2018 , refer to item 7 of part ii in our annual report on form 10-k for the year ended december 31 , 2019 filed with the securities and exchange commission on february 28 , 2020. overview founded in 1954 as part of eli lilly & co. ( lilly ) , elanco is a premier animal health company that innovates , develops , manufactures and markets products for pets and farm animals . headquartered in greenfield , indiana , we are one of the largest animal health companies in the world , with pro forma combined revenue of elanco and bayer animal health of approximately $ 4.4 billion for the year ended december 31 , 2020. excluding bayer animal health , globally , we are # 1 in medicinal feed additives , # 2 in poultry , and # 3 in other pharmaceuticals , which are mainly pet health therapeutics , measured by 2019 revenue , according to vetnosis . we have one of the broadest portfolios of pet parasiticides in the pet health sector . we offer a diverse portfolio of approximately 190 brands that make us a trusted partner to veterinarians and farm animal producers in more than 90 countries . on september 24 , 2018 , we completed our initial public offering ( ipo ) , pursuant to which we issued and sold 19.8 % of our total outstanding shares . on september 20 , 2018 , our common stock began trading on the new york stock exchange ( nyse ) under the symbol “ elan. ” on september 24 , 2018 , immediately preceding the completion of the ipo , lilly transferred to us substantially all of its animal health businesses in exchange for ( i ) all of the net proceeds ( approximately $ 1,659.7 million ) we received from the sale of our common stock in the ipo , including the net proceeds we received as a result of the exercise in full of the underwriters ' option to purchase additional shares , ( ii ) all of the net proceeds ( approximately $ 2,000 million ) we received from the issuance of our senior notes ; and ( iii ) all of the net proceeds ( $ 498.6 million ) we received from the entry into our term loan facility . in addition , immediately prior to the completion of the ipo , we entered into certain agreements with lilly that provide a framework for our ongoing relationship with them . on february 8 , 2019 , lilly announced an exchange offer whereby lilly shareholders could exchange all or a portion of lilly common stock for shares of elanco common stock owned by lilly . on that date , we filed a registration statement on form s-4 with the sec in connection with that exchange offer . the disposition of elanco shares was completed on march 11 , 2019 , and resulted in the full separation of elanco along with the disposal of lilly 's entire ownership and voting interest in elanco . on august 1 , 2020 , we completed the acquisition of bayer animal health . the acquisition expands our pet health product category , advancing our planned portfolio mix transformation and creating a better balance between our farm animal and pet health product categories . our existing product portfolio and pipeline are enhanced by the addition of bayer animal health , which complements our commercial operations and international infrastructure . see note 6 : acquisitions and divestitures to the consolidated and combined financial statements for additional information on the acquisition . subsequent to the acquisition date , our consolidated and combined financial statements include the assets , liabilities , operating results and cash flows of bayer animal health . we operate our business in a single segment directed at fulfilling our vision of enriching the lives of people through food , making protein more accessible and affordable and through pet companionship , helping pets live longer , healthier lives . during the third quarter of 2020 , we renamed our four primary product categories by replacing `` food animal '' and `` companion animal '' with `` farm animal '' and `` pet health , '' respectively , to better reflect the terminology used by our customers . we advance our vision by offering products in these four primary 2020 form 10-k |46 categories : pet health disease prevention ( ph disease prevention ) : we have one of the broadest parasiticide portfolios in the pet health sector based on indications , species and formulations , with products that protect pets from worms , fleas and ticks . our seresto and advantage , advantix , advocate ( collectively referred to as the advantage family ) products represent treatments for the elimination and prevention , respectively , of fleas and ticks . combining our parasiticide portfolio with our vaccines presence , we are a leader in the u.s. in the disease prevention category based on share of revenue . pet health therapeutics ( ph therapeutics ) : we have a broad pain and osteoarthritis portfolio across species , modes of action , indications and disease stages . pet owners are increasingly treating osteoarthritis in their pets , and our galliprant product is one of the fastest growing osteoarthritis treatments in the u.s. we also have treatments for otitis ( ear infections ) with claro , as well as treatments for certain cardiovascular and dermatology indications . farm animal future protein & health ( fa future protein & health ) : our portfolio in this category , which includes vaccines , nutritional enzymes and animal-only antibiotics , serves the growing demand for protein and includes innovative products in poultry and aquaculture production , where demand for animal health products is outpacing overall industry growth . with our maxiban product , we are a leader in the control and prevention of intestinal disease in poultry . story_separator_special_tag if this occurs , even if we are able to increase sales 2020 form 10-k |48 in our direct to retailer and e-commerce channels , which have been important components of the bayer animal health distribution model , those increases may not compensate for reduced sales through veterinary practices . further , demand in our direct to retailer and e-commerce channels could be negatively impacted if global economic conditions do not improve or if they deteriorate further . in our farm animal business , demand has been negatively impacted by processing plant closures , a backlog of animals ready for processing and pressured producer economics , which has and could continue to impact demand for a number of our farm animal products . while the impact has been most significant for the u.s. livestock industry , the pressure has occurred globally and across species . as the pandemic has continued through the beginning of 2021 , our business has been affected by lower levels of demand in certain markets due to unfavorable macroeconomic conditions and reduced food service consumption trends . as a result , the industry has seen pressured prices and producer profitability across species , most notably in poultry and aqua . we anticipate that decreases in end consumer demand as compared to prior year will continue to occur , particularly in the farm animal business , into 2021. our third party distributors may face difficulties maintaining operations and normal liquidity in light of government-mandated restrictions . due to liquidity and working capital pressure caused by the covid-19 pandemic , our distributors are managing inventory more tightly . in response to this along with a shift in tactics for demand generation with our distributors , we reduced channel inventory levels during the first half of 2020 as we tightened our approach across all facets of our distributor relationships . we estimate that this decreased our revenue by approximately $ 160 million . these actions have allowed us to improve working capital management , implement new compensation structures with our distributors and enable greater control of overall stock levels . we continue to monitor the impacts on our customers ' liquidity and therefore our ability to collect on our accounts receivable . while our allowance on these receivables factors in expected credit losses , continued disruption and declines in the global economy could result in difficulties in our ability to collect , which we have not experienced on a material basis at this time . if significant issues with collections occur , material increases in our allowance for doubtful accounts may be required . our acquisition of bayer animal health we have incurred and expect to continue to incur expenses in connection with our acquisition of bayer animal health including fees for professional services such as legal , accounting , consulting , and other advisory fees and expenses . in addition , we have incurred and expect to continue to incur costs related to the build out of processes and systems to support finance and global supply and logistics and to expand administrative functions , including , but not limited to , information technology , facilities management , distribution , human resources , and manufacturing , to replace services previously provided by the former parent company of bayer animal health . we anticipate that these additional costs will be partially offset by expected synergies . product development and new product launches a key element of our targeted value creation strategy is to drive growth through portfolio development and product innovation , primarily in our three targeted growth categories of ph disease prevention , ph therapeutics and fa future protein & health . since 2015 , we have launched or acquired 14 new products , including the additions of entyce , nocita and tanovea in 2019. revenue from these products contributed $ 440.8 million to revenue for the year ended december 31 , 2020. this excludes our most recent acquisition of bayer animal health , which added approximately 65 products to the elanco portfolio that contributed post-acquisition revenues of $ 591.9 million in 2020. the advantage family and seresto contributed approximately $ 151 million and $ 84 million , respectively , to our revenues in 2020. we continue to pursue the development of new chemical and biological molecules through our approach to innovation . our future growth and success depends on both our pipeline of new products , including new products that we may develop through joint ventures and products that we are able to obtain through license or acquisition , and the expansion of the use of our existing products . we believe we are an industry leader in animal health r & d , with a track record of product innovation , business development and commercialization . impact of competition the animal health industry is competitive . established animal health companies which consistently deliver high quality products enjoy brand loyalty from their customers , which often continues after the loss of patent-based or regulatory exclusivity . in animal health , while potentially significant , erosion from generic competition is often not as 2020 form 10-k |49 steep as in human health , with the originator often retaining a significant market share . however , generic competition can nevertheless significantly affect our results . while our largest product , rumensin ( monensin ) , has been subject to generic competition from monensin internationally for more than 10 years , our revenue from international rumensin sales grew at a cagr of 1 % from 2015 to 2020. in the third quarter of 2019 , an established animal health company received u.s. approval for generic monensin in cattle and goats for certain indications . u.s.

simultaneously with the completion of the public offering ( the “ private placement warrants ” ) , our capital stock , debt or a combination of cash , stock and debt . the issuance of additional shares of our stock in a business combination : ● may significantly dilute the equity interest of our stockholders ; ● may subordinate the rights of holders of common stock if preferred stock is issued with rights senior to those afforded our common stock ; ● could cause a change of control if a substantial number of shares of our common stock are issued , which may affect , among other things , our ability to use our net operating loss carry forwards , if any , and could result in the resignation or removal of our present officers and directors ; ● may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control of us by diluting the stock ownership or voting rights of a person seeking to obtain control of us ; and ● may decrease prevailing market prices for our common stock and or warrants . 54 similarly , if we issue debt securities , it could result in : ● a decrease in the prevailing market prices for our common stock and or warrants . ● default and foreclosure on our assets if our operating revenues after an initial business combination are insufficient to repay our debt obligations ; ● acceleration of our obligations to repay the indebtedness even if we make all principal and interest payments when due if we breach certain covenants that require the maintenance of certain financial ratios or reserves without a waiver or renegotiation of that covenant ; ● our immediate payment of all principal and accrued interest , if any , if the debt security is payable on demand ; ● our inability to obtain necessary additional financing if the debt security contains covenants restricting our ability to obtain such financing while the debt security is outstanding ; ● our inability to pay dividends on our common stock ; ● using a substantial portion of our cash flow to pay principal and interest on our debt , which will reduce the funds available for dividends on our common stock if declared , expenses , capital expenditures , acquisitions and other general corporate purposes ; ● limitations on our flexibility in planning for and reacting to changes in our business and in the industry in which we operate ; ● increased vulnerability to adverse changes in general economic , industry and competitive conditions and adverse changes in government regulation ; and ● limitations on our ability to borrow additional amounts for expenses , capital expenditures , acquisitions , debt service requirements , execution of our strategy and other purposes and other disadvantages compared to our competitors who have less debt . as indicated in the accompanying financial statements , at november 30 , 2016 , the trust account consisted of us treasury bills yielding interest of approximately 0.4 % per annum , with a value of $ 70,442,615. we expect to incur significant costs in the pursuit of our acquisition plans . we can not assure you that our plans to complete our initial business combination will be successful . story_separator_special_tag

outstanding during the period , plus to the extent dilutive the incremental number of shares of common stock to settle warrants , as calculated using the treasury stock method . at november 30 , 2016 , the company had outstanding warrants to purchase 14,871,098 shares of common stock . for all periods presented , these shares were excluded from the calculation of diluted loss per share of common

","results of operations for the period from december 8 , 2015 ( inception ) through november 30 , 2016 our activities consisted of formation and preparation for the public offering and subsequent to the public offering , and efforts directed toward locating and completing a suitable business combination . our operating costs for those periods include our search for a business combination and are largely associated with our governance and public reporting , and charges of $ 10,000 per month payable to an affiliate of our sponsor for administrative services . liquidity and capital resources in august 2016 , we consummated the public offering of an aggregate of 6,500,000 units at a price of $ 10.00 per unit generating gross proceeds of approximately $ 65,000,000 before underwriting discounts and expenses . simultaneously with the consummation of the public offering , we consummated the private placement of 7,650,000 private placement warrants , each exercisable to purchase one share of our common stock at $ 11.50 per share , to the sponsor , at a price of $ 0.50 per private placement warrant , generating gross proceeds , before expenses , of approximately $ 3,825,000. we received net proceeds from the public offering and the sale of the private placement warrants of approximately $ 66,906,000 , net of the non-deferred portion of the underwriting commissions of $ 1,300,000 and offering costs and other expenses of approximately $ 619,000. following the partial exercise of the underwriters ' overallotment option on september 28 , 2016 , the company sold an additional 400,610 units at a price of $ 10.00 per unit generating gross proceeds of approximately $ 4,006,100 before underwriting discounts and expenses .

"in 2012 , based on available industry data , private label products sold in the retail grocery channel in the united states , which compete with branded products on the basis of equivalent quality at a lower price , represented approximately 32 % of all shelf stable pickle and pepper products , approximately 49 % of all non-dairy powdered creamer , approximately 16 % of all powdered drinks , approximately 20 % of all salad dressings and approximately 18 % of all canned soup . we sell our products primarily to the retail grocery and foodservice channels . for the year ended december 31 , 2012 , sales to the retail grocery and foodservice channels represented 71.9 % and 15.5 % , respectively , of our consolidated net sales . the remaining 12.6 % represented industrial and export sales . a majority of our sales are private label products . we intend to grow our business profitably through the following strategic initiatives : expand partnerships with retailers : as grocery retailers become more demanding of their private label food product suppliers , they have come to expect strategic insight , product innovation , customer service and logistical economies of scale similar to those of our branded competitors . to this end , we are continually developing , investing in and expanding our private label food product offerings and capabilities in these areas . in addition to our low cost manufacturing , we have invested in research and development , product and packaging innovation , category management , information technology systems and other capabilities . we believe that these investments enable us to provide a broad and growing array of private label food products that generally meet or exceed the value and quality of branded competitors that have comparable sales , marketing , innovation and category management support . we believe that we are well positioned to expand our market share with grocery retailers given our differentiated capabilities , breadth of product offering and geographic reach . utilize our scale and innovation to meet customer needs : the u.s. retail food industry has continued to bifurcate from traditional food retailers ( those who carry a full array of refrigerated , frozen and shelf stable products ) to specialty retailers who cater to consumers who migrate to either end of the value spectrum . these specialty retailers tend to focus on either value offerings for consumers looking for the maximum value of their food purchases , or catering to consumers looking for the highest quality ingredients , unique packaging or products to satisfy particular dietary needs . we offer a broad array of innovative products that meet the good , better and best needs of both traditional grocers and specialty retailers . continue to drive growth and profitability from our existing product portfolio : we believe we can continue to drive organic growth from our existing product portfolio . through insights gained from our economic value added ( eva ) analyses , we develop operating strategies that enable us to focus our resources and investments on products and categories that we believe offer the highest potential . additionally , eva analyses identify products and categories that lag the broader portfolio and require corrective action . we believe eva analysis is a helpful tool that maximizes the full potential of our product offerings . leverage cross-selling opportunities across customers , sales channels and geographies : while we have high private label food product market shares in the united states for our non-dairy powdered creamer , soup , salad dressing , powdered drinks , instant hot cereals , and pickles , as well as significant branded and private label food product market share in jams in canada , we believe we still have significant potential for growth with grocery retailers and foodservice distributors that we either 21 currently serve in a limited manner , or do not currently serve . we believe that certain customers view our size and scale as an advantage over smaller private label food product producers , many of whom provide only a single category or service to a single customer or geography . our ability to service customers across north america and across a wider spectrum of products and capabilities provides many opportunities for cross-selling to customers who seek to reduce the number of private label food product suppliers they utilize . growth through acquisitions : we believe we have the expertise and demonstrated ability to identify and integrate value-enhancing acquisitions . we selectively pursue acquisitions of complementary businesses that we believe are a compelling strategic fit with our existing operations . each potential acquisition is evaluated for merit utilizing a rigorous analysis that assesses targets for their market attractiveness , intrinsic value and strategic fit . we believe our acquisitions have been successful and consistent with our strategy . since we began operating as an independent company in 2005 , our acquisitions have significantly added to our revenue base , enhanced margins and allowed us to expand from an initial base of two center-of-store , shelf stable food categories to more than ten . we attempt to maintain conservative financial policies when pursuing acquisitions and our proven integration strategies have resulted in rapid deleveraging . by identifying targets that fit within our defined strategies , we believe we can continue to expand our product selection and continue our efforts to be the low-cost , high quality and innovative supplier of private label food products for our customers . the acquisition market in 2012 was relatively quiet , as sellers were generally waiting for an opportunity to sell when conditions improved . this resulted in a higher level of bolt-on or tuck-in acquisitions of smaller entities . for example , we acquired substantially all of the assets of naturally fresh for approximately $ 26 million , and the aseptic cheese and pudding business of associated milk producers , inc. ( ampi ) for $ 4 million . these two deals are substantially smaller in size compared to the larger acquisitions we completed in the past . story_separator_special_tag production at the seaforth , ontario facility is expected to end in the second quarter of 2013 , with full plant closure expected in the third quarter of 2013. total costs to close the seaforth facility are expected to be approximately $ 12.8 million , which decreased from $ 13.6 million as reported in the third quarter of 2012 , as a result of refined estimates . components of the charges include non-cash accelerated depreciation of approximately $ 7.1 million , severance of approximately $ 3.3 million , and other closure costs of approximately $ 2.4 million . concurrent with the restructurings noted above , the company reviewed the fixed assets for impairment at the product category level and no impairment was indicated . during the review , the useful lives of the related assets were reassessed and shortened to be consistent with the dates that production at the facilities were expected to 23 end . the change in estimated useful lives related to the restructurings resulted in $ 10.7 million of accelerated depreciation in 2012. we expect to incur an additional $ 11.3 million of accelerated depreciation through the second quarter of 2013. on april 13 , 2012 , the company completed its acquisition of substantially all of the assets of naturally fresh , inc. ( naturally fresh ) , a privately owned atlanta , georgia based manufacturer of refrigerated dressings , sauces , marinades , dips and specialty items sold within each of our segments . the company paid a purchase price of approximately $ 26 million for the business , net of cash . the acquisition was financed through borrowings under the company 's revolving credit facility . the acquisition expanded the company 's refrigerated manufacturing and packaging capabilities , broadened its distribution footprint and further developed its presence within the growing category of fresh foods . naturally fresh 's atlanta facility , coupled with the company 's existing west coast and chicago based refrigerated food plants , is expected to allow the company to more efficiently service customers from coast to coast . on january 10 , 2012 , the company repaid its cross-border intercompany loans with its canadian subsidiary , e.d . smith . the repayment totaled $ 67.7 million and included both principal and interest . payment was financed with borrowings under our revolving credit facility . the loans were fully repaid and canceled at the time of payment . during 2012 , the cash was held by e.d . smith in short term investments as cash and cash equivalents . we expect to use the cash for general corporate purposes in canada , including capital projects and acquisitions . the cash relates to foreign earnings that , if repatriated , would result in a tax liability . story_separator_special_tag following : replace_table_token_10_th net sales increased in 2012 compared to 2011 due to the acquisition of naturally fresh and price increases , partially offset by decreased volumes in pickles , aseptic products , and mexican sauces . cost of sales as a percentage of net sales increased from 79.5 % in 2011 to 81.0 % in 2012 , due to increases in operating and raw material costs , and a shift in sales mix , partially offset by increased pricing and decreases in packaging costs . freight out and commissions paid to independent brokers increased $ 1.1 million in 2012 compared to 2011 , primarily due to the acquisition of naturally fresh . freight costs did not decrease in this segment as they did for the north american retail grocery segment , as most customers pick up their products . freight and commissions were 3.7 % of net sales , consistent with the prior year rate of 3.6 % . direct selling and marketing expenses were $ 8.0 million in 2012 compared to $ 7.0 million in 2011 reflecting the acquisition of naturally fresh . industrial and export replace_table_token_11_th 27 net sales in the industrial and export segment decreased by $ 10.2 million , or 3.6 % , for the year ended december 31 , 2012 compared to the prior year . the change in net sales from 2011 to 2012 was due to the following : replace_table_token_12_th the decrease in net sales is primarily due to volume/mix decreases , partially offset by pricing . the volume decrease was primarily due to decreases in soup , non-dairy creamer , and infant feeding sales volumes . cost of sales , as a percentage of net sales , increased from 80.1 % in 2011 to 81.1 % in 2012 primarily due to a shift in sales mix , and increases in operating and raw material costs that were partially offset by price increases and decreases in packaging costs . freight out and commissions paid to independent sales brokers were $ 5.9 million in 2012 compared to $ 6.8 million in 2011 , due to lower volumes that resulted in lower freight costs and commissions . direct selling and marketing was $ 1.5 million in 2012 compared to $ 1.8 million in 2011. year ended december 31 , 2011 compared to year ended december 31 , 2010 net sales net sales increased 12.8 % to $ 2,050.0 million for the year ended december 31 , 2011 , compared to $ 1,817.0 million , for the year ended december 31 , 2010. net sales by segment are shown in the following table : replace_table_token_13_th the increase was driven by the acquisitions of sturm and s.t . foods in 2010 , increases in pricing needed to offset higher input costs , favorable foreign currency exchange rates between the u.s. and canadian dollar and a favorable product mix . cost of sales all expenses incurred to bring a product to completion are included in cost of sales , such as raw materials , ingredient and packaging costs , labor costs , facility and equipment costs , including costs to operate and maintain our warehouses , and costs associated with transporting our finished products from our manufacturing facilities to distribution centers .

"advances on used inventory mature 366 days from the advance date . each advance is subject to a curtailment schedule , which requires that we pay down the balance of each advance on a periodic basis , starting after six months for used inventory and one year for new inventory . the curtailment schedule varies based story_separator_special_tag the following should be read in conjunction with part i , including the matters set forth in the risk factors section of this report , and our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this report . overview we are the largest recreational boat retailer in the united states with fiscal 2011 revenue in excess of $ 475 million . through our current 54 retail locations in 19 states , we sell new and used recreational boats and related marine products , including engines , trailers , parts , and accessories . we also arrange related boat financing , insurance , and extended service contracts ; provide boat repair and maintenance services ; offer yacht and boat brokerage services ; and , where available , offer slip and storage accommodations . we recently implemented programs to increase substantially our sale over the internet of used boats and a wide range of boating parts , accessories , supplies , and products ; the sale of used boats , boating parts , and accessories , as well as the offer of f & i products at various offsite locations ; and the charter of power and sailing yachts . none of these programs has had a material effect on our financial statements . marinemax was incorporated in january 1998. we commenced operations with the acquisition of five independent recreational boat dealers on march 1 , 1998. since the initial acquisitions in march 1998 , we have acquired 21 recreational boat dealers , two boat brokerage operations , and two full-service yacht repair facilities . as a part of our acquisition strategy , we frequently engage in discussions with various recreational boat dealers regarding their potential acquisition by us . potential acquisition discussions frequently take place over a long period of time and involve difficult business integration and other issues , including , in some cases , management succession and related matters . as a result of these and other factors , a number of potential acquisitions that from time to time appear likely to occur do not result in binding legal agreements and are not consummated . we did not complete any significant acquisitions during the fiscal years ended september 30 , 2009 or 2010 and completed a relatively small acquisition in fiscal 2011. general economic conditions and consumer spending patterns can negatively impact our operating results . unfavorable local , regional , national , or global economic developments or uncertainties regarding future economic prospects could reduce consumer spending in the markets we serve and adversely affect our business . economic conditions in areas in which we operate dealerships , particularly florida in which we generated 45 % , 54 % , and 50 % of our revenue during fiscal 2009 , 2010 , and 2011 , respectively , can have a major impact on our operations . local influences , such as corporate downsizing , military base closings , inclement weather , and environmental conditions , such as the bp oil spill in the gulf of mexico , also could adversely affect our operations in certain markets . in an economic downturn , consumer discretionary spending levels generally decline , at times resulting in disproportionately large reductions in the sale of luxury goods . consumer spending on luxury goods also may decline as a result of lower consumer confidence levels , even if prevailing economic conditions are favorable . although we have expanded our operations during periods of stagnant or modestly declining industry trends , the cyclical nature of the recreational boating industry or the lack of industry growth may adversely affect our business , financial condition , and results of operations . any period of adverse economic conditions or low consumer confidence has a negative effect on our business . 44 lower consumer spending resulting from a downturn in the housing market and other economic factors adversely affected our business in fiscal 2007 and continued weakness in consumer spending resulting from substantial weakness in the financial markets and deteriorating economic conditions had a very substantial negative effect on our business in fiscal 2008 , 2009 , 2010 , and 2011. these conditions caused us to defer our acquisition program , delay new store openings , reduce our inventory purchases , engage in inventory reduction efforts , close a number of our retail locations , reduce our headcount , and amend and replace our credit facility . acquisitions and new store openings remain important strategies to our company , and we plan to resume our growth through these strategies when more normal economic conditions return . however , we can not predict the length or severity of these unfavorable economic or financial conditions or the extent to which they will continue to adversely affect our operating results nor can we predict the effectiveness of the measures we have taken to address this environment or whether additional measures will be necessary . although economic conditions have adversely affected our operating results , we have capitalized on our core strengths to substantially outperform the industry , resulting in market share gains . our ability to capture such market share supports the alignment of our retailing strategies with the desires of consumers . we believe the steps we have taken to address weak market conditions will yield an increase in future revenue . as general economic trends improve , we expect our core strengths and retailing strategies will position us to capitalize on growth opportunities as they occur and will allow us to emerge from this challenging economic environment with greater earnings potential . application of critical accounting policies we have identified the policies below as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations . story_separator_special_tag stock-based compensation we account for our share-based compensation plans following the provisions of fasb accounting standards codification 718 , compensation  stock compensation ( asc 718 ) . in accordance with asc 718 , we use the black-scholes valuation model for valuing all stock-based compensation and shares purchased under our employee stock purchase plan . we measure compensation for restricted stock awards and restricted stock units at fair value on the grant date based on the number of shares expected to vest and the quoted market price of our common stock . for restricted stock units with market conditions , we utilize a monte carlo simulation embedded in a lattice model to determine the fair value . we recognize compensation cost for all awards in earnings , net of estimated forfeitures , on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period for each separately vesting portion of the award . 46 income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with fasb accounting standards codification 740 , income taxes ( asc 740 ) . under asc 740 , we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis . we measure deferred tax assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which we expect those temporary differences to be recovered or settled . we record valuation allowances to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized by considering all available positive and negative evidence . pursuant to asc 740 , we must consider all positive and negative evidence regarding the realization of deferred tax assets , including past operating results and future sources of taxable income . under the provisions of asc 740-10 , we determined that our net deferred tax asset needed to be fully reserved given recent earnings and industry trends . the worker , homeownership , and business assistance act of 2009 was signed into law in november 2009. this act allowed us to carryback our 2009 net operating loss , which had a valuation allowance recorded against the entire amount and which we were not able to carryback under the prior tax law . the additional carryback generated a tax refund of $ 19.2 million . the tax refund was recorded as income tax benefit during our quarter ended december 31 , 2009 , the period in which this act was enacted . we filed a carryback claim with the internal revenue service , and we received a $ 19.2 million refund in the quarter ended march 31 , 2010. for a more comprehensive list of our accounting policies , including those which involve varying degrees of judgment , see note 2  significant accounting policies of notes to consolidated financial statements . story_separator_special_tag percentage of revenue of approximately 1.8 % from 26.1 % for the fiscal year ended september 30 , 2009 to 27.9 % for the fiscal year ended september 30 , 2010. this increase in selling , general , and administrative expenses ( with such adjustments ) as a percentage of revenue was primarily attributable to the reported same-store sales decline , which reduced our ability to leverage our expense structure . interest expense . interest expense decreased $ 10.2 million , or 72.1 % , to $ 3.9 million for the fiscal year ended september 30 , 2010 from $ 14.1 million for the fiscal year ended september 30 , 2009. the decrease was primarily a result of decreased borrowings under our credit facility . interest expense as a percentage of revenue decreased to 0.9 % for the fiscal year ended september 30 , 2010 from 2.4 % for the fiscal year ended september 30 , 2009 because of the reductions in average borrowings on our credit facility . income tax benefit . our income tax benefit for the fiscal year ended september 30 , 2010 was $ 19.6 million compared with $ 8.6 million for the fiscal year ended september 30 , 2009. the increase in our tax benefit was primarily due to the enactment of the worker , homeownership , and business assistance act of 2009 , which was signed into law in november 2009. this act allowed us to carryback our 2009 net operating loss , which previously had a valuation allowance recorded against the entire amount and which we were not able to carryback under the prior tax law . the additional carryback generated a tax refund of $ 19.2 million . this tax refund was recorded as income tax benefit during the quarter ended december 31 , 2009 , the period in which this act was enacted . we filed a carryback claim with the internal revenue service , and we received a $ 19.2 million refund in the quarter ended march 31 , 2010. quarterly data and seasonality our business , as well as the entire recreational boating industry , is highly seasonal , with seasonality varying in different geographic markets . with the exception of florida , we generally realize significantly lower sales and higher levels of inventories , and related short-term borrowings , in the quarterly periods ending december 31 and march 31. the onset of the public boat and recreation shows in january stimulates boat sales and allows us to typically reduce our inventory levels and related short-term borrowings throughout the remainder of the fiscal year . our business could become substantially more seasonal if we acquire dealers that operate in colder regions of the united states or close retail locations in warm climates . our business is also subject to weather patterns , which may adversely affect our results of operations . for example , drought conditions ( or merely reduced rainfall levels ) or excessive rain , may close area boating locations or render boating dangerous or inconvenient , thereby curtailing customer demand for our products and services .
","results of operations the following table sets forth certain financial data as a percentage of revenue for the periods indicated : replace_table_token_8_th fiscal year ended september 30 , 2011 compared with fiscal year ended september 30 , 2010 revenue . revenue increased $ 30.6 million , or 6.8 % , to $ 480.9 million for the fiscal year ended september 30 , 2011 from $ 450.3 million for the fiscal year ended september 30 , 2010. of this increase , $ 34.3 million was attributable to an 8 % increase in comparable-store sales , which was partially offset by a decline of $ 3.7 million related to stores opened or closed that were not eligible for inclusion in the comparable-store base for the 12 months ended september 30 , 2011. the increase in our comparable-store sales was due to an increase in new boat sales , offset by a decline in used boat sales , because less used boats were available for sale for most of fiscal 2011 compared with fiscal 2010. our retail sales continue to be adversely impacted by the ongoing economic pressure on our industry . 47 gross profit . gross profit increased $ 8.7 million , or 7.8 % , to $ 119.5 million for the fiscal year ended september 30 , 2011 from $ 110.8 million for the fiscal year ended september 30 , 2010. gross profit as a percentage of revenue increased to 24.9 % for the fiscal year ended september 30 , 2011 from 24.6 % for the fiscal year ended september 30 , 2010. the increase in gross profit was primarily attributable to incrementally increased margins on boat sales due to improving industry inventory conditions . selling , general , and administrative expenses .

( 2 ) it is “ more likely than not ” that the company will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis ; or ( 3 ) for debt securities , the present value of expected cash flows is not sufficient to recover the entire amortized cost basis . for all impaired debt securities that are intended for sale , or more likely than not will be required to sell , the full amount of the loss is recognized as otti through earnings . credit related otti for all other impaired debt securities is recognized through earnings . non-credit related otti for such debt securities is recognized in other comprehensive income , net of applicable taxes . should actual factors and conditions differ materially from those expected by management , the actual realization of gains or losses on investment securities could differ materially from the amounts recorded in the financial statements . deferred income taxes in accordance with asc topic 740 , “ income taxes , ” certain aspects of accounting for income taxes require significant management judgment , including assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets ( dtas ) . such judgments are subjective and involve estimates and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain . should actual factors and conditions differ materially from those used by management , the actual realization of dtas could differ materially from the amounts recorded in the consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes thereto . dtas generally represent items for which a benefit has been recognized for financial accounting purposes that can not be realized for tax purposes until a future period . the realization of dtas depends upon future sources of taxable income . valuation allowances are established for those dtas determined not likely to be realized based on management 's judgment . 36 emerging growth company the jobs act permits us , as an “ emerging growth company ” , to take advantage of an extended transition period to comply with new or revised accounting standards and not commence complying with new or revised accounting standards until private companies must do so . under the jobs act , we may make an irrevocable election to “ opt out ” of that extended transition period and comply with new or revised accounting standards when public companies that are not emerging growth companies must commence complying with those standards . we have elected to “ opt out ” of the extended transition period . earnings overview 2018 earnings overview our net income for the year ended december 31 , 2018 was $ 17.4 million , an increase of $ 3.6 million , or 26.1 % , compared to the year ended december 31 , 2017. net income available to common shareholders for the year ended december 31 , 2018 was $ 17.4 million , or $ 2.21 per diluted share , compared to net income available to common shareholders of $ 13.8 million , or $ 1.78 per diluted share for the year ended december 31 , 2017. our returns on average shareholders ' equity and average assets for the year ended december 31 , 2018 , were 10.19 % and 0.94 % , respectively , compared to 8.93 % and 0.80 % , respectively for the year ended december 31 , 2017. the increase in net income for 2018 compared to 2017 was primarily a result of higher net interest income and income tax expense savings resulting from the tax law change enacted in 2017. net interest income for the year ended december 31 , 2018 was $ 56.3 million , an

"our medical device systems automate the collection and processing of donated blood components , assess likelihood for blood loss , salvage and process blood from surgery patients , and dispense and track blood inventory in the hospital . these systems include devices and single-use , proprietary disposable sets ( “ disposables ” ) that operate only with our specialized devices . specifically , our plasma and blood center systems allow users to collect and process only the blood component ( s ) they target — plasma , platelets , or red blood cells — increasing donor and patient safety as well as collection efficiencies . our blood diagnostics system assesses hemostasis ( a patient 's clotting ability ) to aid clinicians in assessing the cause of bleeding resulting in overall reductions in blood product usage . our surgical blood salvage systems allow surgeons to collect the blood lost by a patient in surgery , cleanse the blood , and make it available for transfusion back to the patient . our blood tracking systems automate the distribution of blood products in the hospital . our business services products include blood management , six sigma , and lean manufacturing consulting , which support our customers ' needs for regulatory compliance and operational efficiency in the blood supply chain . we either sell our devices to customers ( resulting in equipment revenue ) or place our devices with customers subject to certain conditions . when the device remains our property , the customer has the right to use it for a period of time as long as the customer meets certain conditions we have established , which , among other things , generally include one or more of the following : purchase and consumption of a minimum level of disposables products ; payment of monthly rental fees ; and an asset utilization performance metric , such as performing a minimum level of procedures per month per device . our disposables revenue stream , which includes the sales of disposables and fees for the use of our equipment , accounted for approximately 81.7 % , 81.5 % and 86.0 % of our total revenue for fiscal 2012 , 2011 and 2010 , respectively . in april 2012 , we announced two acquisitions that will provide us with a commercial presence in all aspects of the whole blood collection market , a market in which historically we have not meaningfully participated . we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire the business assets of the blood collection , filtration and processing product lines of pall corporation for $ 551 million . the blood processing systems and equipment to be acquired are for use in transfusion medicine and include pall 's manufacturing facilities in covina , california ; tijuana , mexico ; ascoli , italy and a portion of pall 's assets in fajardo , puerto rico . approximately 1,300 employees will be transferred to haemonetics . we also entered into a definitive agreement to acquire the business assets of hemerus medical , llc , a minnesota-based company that develops innovative technologies for the collection of whole blood , and processing and storage of blood components . under the terms of the agreement , we will pay up to $ 27 million contingent upon on certain regulatory approvals . we expect both acquisitions to close in the second quarter of fiscal 2013. market trends plasma market changes in demand for plasma-derived pharmaceuticals , particularly immunoglobulin ( “ ig ” ) , is the key driver of plasma collection volumes in the commercial plasma collection market . various factors related to the supply of plasma and the production of plasma-derived pharmaceuticals also affect demand , including the following : industry consolidation continues among plasma collectors and fractionators . industry consolidation impacts us when a collector changes the total number of its collection centers , the total number of collections performed per center or changes the plasma collection system ( either haemonetics or a competitive technology ) used to perform some or all of those collections . the supply of source plasma also affects demand for additional collections of source plasma . the newer plasma fractionation facilities are more efficient in their production processes , utilizing less plasma to make similar quantities of pharmaceuticals and vaccines . reimbursement guidelines affect the demand for end product pharmaceuticals , although a high off-label use of 20 pharmaceuticals occurs . newly approved indications and diagnosis of new patients requiring plasma derived therapies increase the demand for plasma , along with longer lifespans and a growing aging patient population requiring therapy , and bio-pharmaceutical geographical expansion . demand for plasma in fiscal 2012 was particularly strong in north america where approximately two-thirds of commercial plasma is collected . while global markets for plasmapheresis have been relatively flat , the market in japan has declined . the japanese red cross has shifted some of its plasma for fractionation from plasmapheresis to recovered plasma from whole blood collections . this change has reduced demand for automated plasma collections . currently , demand for plasma-derived therapies is driving mid-single digit growth of plasma collection . blood center market in the blood center market , we sell products used in the collection of platelets and red cells . despite modest increases in the demand for platelets in europe and japan , improved collection efficiencies that increase the yield of platelets per collection and more efficient use of collected platelets have resulted in a flat market for automated collections and related disposables in these countries . with changes in healthcare and social security systems in emerging markets , a larger number of people get access to state of the art medical treatments , which drives the demand for platelet transfusions and represent a faster growing market . after several years of modest increases in demand for red cell transfusions and a general shortage of volunteer donors , the market in recent years has experienced lower demand for red cells due to slow growth in elective procedures coupled with increased focus on better blood management practices . story_separator_special_tag without the effects of foreign exchange , plasma disposables revenue increased 12.7 % during fiscal 2012 , primarily due to increased plasma collections by our commercial fractionation customers in north america . we expect collection growth rates to moderate in fiscal 2013. also , recent contract renewals for the majority of the current commercial plasma business included price decreases which we expect will adversely affect the revenue growth rate for fiscal 2013. plasma disposables revenue decreased 2.2 % during fiscal 2011 . without the effects of foreign exchange , plasma disposables revenue decreased 1.3 % during fiscal 2011 . this decrease was driven by lower apheresis plasma collection volume in japan as more plasma was sourced by the japanese red cross as a byproduct from its whole blood collections . additionally , one of our significant customers removed one of its products from the market , which negatively affected our sales in the u.s. and europe . finally , our commercial plasma customers slowed their growth and in some cases reduced collections in the first half of fiscal 2011 following several years of significant growth . blood center blood center consists of disposables used to collect platelets , red cells , and plasma for transfusion . platelet platelet disposables revenue increased 7.5 % during fiscal 2012 . without the effect of foreign exchange , platelet disposable revenue increased 2.5 % during fiscal 2012 . the increase included the benefit of quality issues experienced with a competitor 's device in japan , increased sales in emerging markets , and purchases by the japanese red cross in march 2012 to avoid future supply disruptions in anticipation of an internal business system conversion . we expect the platelet disposable revenue growth rate for the first quarter of fiscal 2013 to be negatively impacted by these japanese red cross purchases . platelet disposables revenue increased 3.5 % during fiscal 2011 . without the effect of foreign exchange , platelet disposable revenue increased 1.5 % during fiscal 2011 . sales increased across emerging markets throughout the fiscal year , which is the primary driver of the increase in revenue . sales declines in our european direct market were attributable to competition and the switch from apheresis platelets to platelets derived from whole blood collections , which is the primary driver for the decline in net revenue in europe . red cell red cell disposables revenue increased 2.6 % during fiscal 2012 . without the effects of foreign exchange , red cell disposables revenue increased 2.6 % during fiscal 2012 , driven primarily by increased account penetration at existing customers for red cells in north america . red cell disposables revenue decreased 2.5 % during fiscal 2011 . without the effects of foreign exchange , red cell disposables revenue decreased 2.0 % during fiscal 2011 . the decrease was driven by lower demand for red cells as a result of fewer surgeries , resulting in a reduced demand for automated red cell collection . hospital hospital consists of surgical , orthopat , and diagnostics products . the hospital product line includes the following brand platforms : the cell saver brand , the teg brand , the orthopat brand and the cardiopat brand . surgical surgical disposables revenue consists principally of the cell saver and cardiopat products . revenue from our surgical disposables increased 0.2 % during fiscal 2012 . without the effect of foreign exchange , surgical disposables revenue decreased 2.2 % during fiscal 2012 , due to competitive pressures and a decrease in demand across our european and north american markets associated with lower surgical volumes . during fiscal 2012 , we introduced the cell saver elite , our next generation surgical device , first in north america and then across all geographies . based on results observed for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 , this new device is gaining traction in the marketplace and should positively impact fiscal 2013 surgical disposables 26 revenue results . revenue from our surgical disposables decreased 4.9 % during fiscal 2011 . without the effect of foreign exchange , surgical disposables revenue decreased 4.8 % for the fiscal year due to a decrease in demand across our european and north american markets , driven by both competitive pressures and market conditions resulting in fewer surgeries . this decrease was partly offset by strong sales in our emerging markets . orthopat revenue from our orthopat disposables decreased 12.5 % during fiscal 2012 . without the effect of foreign exchange , orthopat disposables revenue decreased by 13.4 % . the voluntary recall of our orthopat devices manufactured prior to 2002 initiated during the first quarter adversely impacted our business . we have substantially completed the replacement of devices with our customers as of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 . revenue from our orthopat disposables decreased 3.9 % during fiscal 2011 . without the effect of foreign exchange , orthopat disposables revenue decreased by 3.7 % . the decline in fiscal 2011 revenue was driven by a decrease in the frequency of use of the orthopat . diagnostics diagnostics product revenue consists of the teg products . teg revenues increased 18.9 % during fiscal 2012 . without the effect of foreign exchange , diagnostic product revenue increased by 19.2 % . the revenue increase is due to continued adoption of our teg analyzer , including expansion with north american hospitals and sales growth in china . revenue from our diagnostics products increased 15.8 % during fiscal 2011 . without the effect of foreign exchange , diagnostic product revenue increased by 15.7 % . the revenue increase is due to new adoption of this

"in addition to historical financial information , the following discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements that involve risks , uncertainties , and assumptions . our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated by these forward-looking statements as a result of many factors . we discuss factors that we believe could cause or contribute to these differences below and elsewhere in this form 10-k , including those set forth under “ risk factors ” and “ forward-looking statements. ” overview we are a clinical-stage immunotherapy company focused on reprograming the patient 's innate immune system to treat disease . we do this by targeting three key cells of the innate immune system , natural killer , or nk cells , and myeloid derived suppressor cells , or mdsc and microglial cells of the central nervous system . nk cells are the body 's first line of defense due to their innate ability to rapidly seek and destroy abnormal cells , such as cancer or virally-infected cells , without prior exposure or activation by other support molecules required to activate adaptive immune cells such as t-cells . nk cells play a key role in the immune-surveillance that prevents people from getting cancer and in eliminating residual disease which may cause people to relapse after cytotoxic therapy . mdsc are myeloid cells that develop secondary to the chronic inflammatory environment found in many cancers . mdsc , produced in the bone marrow , take up residence in the tumor microenvironment , the tissue associated with the cancerous cells , to protect to the tumor from immunological attack by the patient 's immune system . mdsc play a critical role in making the cancer resistant to immunotherapy such as currently approved checkpoint inhibitors . microglial cells are the primary immune cells of the central nervous system responsible for protecting the neural unit of microglia , astrocytes , oligodendrocytes and neurons from infection . in the setting of chronic inflammation , microglial cells become activated and cause dysfunction of the other three cells types in the neural unit resulting in neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric diseases . inb03 and xpro1595 are the identical drug used in different therapeutic arenas . inb03 is the name of the drug for cancer targeted applications . xpro1595 in the name of the drug for neurology and psychiatric indications . 59 we believe inkmune , our nk cell directed therapy , and inb03 and our mdsc directed therapy our microglial directed offer unique strategies to improve the response of patient 's the innate immune system to their cancer . these therapies will use a precision medicine approach to select patients who will benefit from the therapy and monitor the response to the therapy . neither therapy is cancer specific . the decision to use either inkmune or inb03 alone or in combination other cancer therapies or with each other depends on immunologic parameters that can be tested in patients before treatment . the type of cancer is not important . this means that both therapies can be used to treat patients wide varied to hematologic malignancies and solid tumors that have the immunologic profile needed to respond . put simply , we are treating the immune system to attack the patients the cancer , not targeting the patient 's cancer directly . likewise , we believe xpro1595 , our microglial directed therapy , offers a unique strategy to decrease neuroinflammation , a key pathophysiology in neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric diseases . xpro1595 will use a precision medicine approach to select patients who will benefit from the therapy and monitor the response to the therapy . the therapy is not diagnosis specific but will be used in patients who have biomarkers of neuroinflammation . our initial program with xpro1595 will be treating patients with mild to moderate alzheimer 's disease with biomarkers inflammation . we believe that inkmune improves the ability of the patient 's own nk cells to attack their tumor . inkmune itself will not kill cancer cells . inkmune interacts with the patient 's nk cells to convert them from an inert resting nk cells that ignores the cancer into a primed nk cells that kills the cancer cell . inkmune is a replication incompetent proprietary cell line we have named inb16 that is given to the patient after determining that i ) the patient has adequate nk cells in their circulation and ii ) those nk cells are functional when exposed to inkmune in vitro . inkmune is designed to be given to patients after their immune system has recovered after cytotoxic chemotherapy to target the residual disease the remains after treatment with cytotoxic therapy . inb03 , shown in figure 4 above , is an engineered protein therapeutic that neutralizes soluble tnf using dominant-negative technology . dominant-negative tnf biology is possible because of the unique properties of tnf . tnf is comprised of 3 identical proteins that form a homotrimer that bind the tnf receptor . inb03 , a mutated form of the monomer , can displace one or more of the monomers for the stnf homotrimer to form a heterotrimer . the heterotrimer is unable to bind tnfr . without stnf/tnfr interaction , there is not biologic affect . this is shown in figure 5 below . 60 the unique mechanism of action allows inb03 to be the only selective tnf inhibitor that affects only stnf . all currently available tnf inhibitors are non-selective tnf inhibitors that block both stnf and tmtnf . this functional difference shown in figure 6 below translates into therapeutic differences . the most obvious in the use of a tnf inhibitor in the treatment of cancer patients is related to safety . non-selective tnf inhibitors are immunosuppressive because they inhibit both stnf and tmtnf . inb03 is not immunosuppressive because it inhibits only stnf and allows tmtnf to function normally ( please refer to figure 3 ) . story_separator_special_tag we classify our operating expenses into three categories : royalties and cost of licensing ; research and development ; and selling , general and administrative expenses . personnel costs including salaries , benefits , bonuses and stock-based compensation expense comprise a significant component of our research and development and selling , general and administrative expense categories . we allocate expenses associated with our facilities and information technology costs between these two categories based on the nature of each cost . 62 as a company with less than $ 1 billion in revenue during our last fiscal year , we qualify as an “ emerging growth company ” under the jobs act . as an emerging growth company , we may take advantage of specified reduced disclosure and other requirements that are otherwise applicable generally to public companies . these provisions include : · only two years of audited financial statements in addition to any required unaudited interim financial statements with correspondingly reduced “ management 's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ” disclosure ; · reduced disclosure about our executive compensation arrangements ; · no non-binding advisory votes on executive compensation or golden parachute arrangements ; · exemption from the auditor attestation requirement in the assessment of our internal control over financial reporting ; and · delaying the adoption of new or revised accounting standards that have different effective dates for public and private companies until those standards apply to private companies . we have elected to take advantage of the above-referenced exemptions and we may take advantage of these exemptions for up to five years or such earlier time that we are no longer an emerging growth company . we would cease to be an emerging growth company if we have more than $ 1 billion in annual revenues , we have more than $ 700 million in market value of our stock held by non-affiliates , or we issue more than $ 1 billion of non-convertible debt over a three-year period . we may choose to take advantage of some but not all of these reduced burdens . royalties and cost of licensing royalties and cost of licensing primarily consists of our expenses related to the generation of revenue from our license agreements . these expenses primarily consist of royalty payments made pursuant to our in-licensing agreements and patent amortization expense . we have in-licensing agreements with various parties for the right to use their products and / or intellectual property . we expect our royalty payments to be small until we advance our products through the clinic and generate sales . research and development research and development expense consists of expenses incurred while performing research and development activities to discover and develop our product candidates . this includes conducting preclinical studies and clinical trials , manufacturing development efforts and activities related to regulatory filings for product candidates . we recognize research and development expenses as they are incurred . our research and development expense primarily consist of : · clinical trial and regulatory-related costs ; · expenses incurred under agreements with investigative sites and consultants that conduct our clinical trials ; · manufacturing and testing costs and related supplies and materials ; · employee-related expenses , including salaries , benefits , travel and stock-based compensation ; and · facility expenses dedicated to research and development . 63 we typically use our employee , consultant and infrastructure resources across our development programs . we track outsourced development costs by product candidate or development program , but we do not allocate personnel costs , other internal costs or external consultant costs to specific product candidates or development programs . substantially all of our research and development expenses to date have been incurred in connection with our product candidates . we expect our research and development expenses to increase significantly for the foreseeable future as we advance an increased number of our product candidates through clinical development , including the conduct of our planned clinical trials . the process of conducting clinical trials necessary to obtain regulatory approval is costly and time consuming . the successful development of product candidates is highly uncertain . at this time , we can not reasonably estimate the nature , timing or costs required to complete the remaining development of any product candidates . this is due to the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with the development of product candidates . the costs of clinical trials may vary significantly over the life of a project owing to , but not limited to , the following : · per patient trial costs ; · the number of sites included in the clinical trials ; · the countries in which the clinical trials are conducted ; · the length of time required to enroll eligible patients ; · the number of patients that participate in the clinical trials ; · the number of doses that patients receive ; · the cost of comparative agents used in clinical trials ; · the drop-out or discontinuation rates of patients ; · potential additional safety monitoring or other studies requested by regulatory agencies ; · the duration of patient follow-up ; and · the efficacy and safety profile of the product candidate . we do not expect any of our product candidates to be commercially available for at least the next several years , if ever . we expect to continue to incur significant expenses and increasing operating losses for the foreseeable future , which may fluctuate significantly from quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year .
","results of operations comparison of the years ended december 31 , 2018 and december 31 , 2017 replace_table_token_2_th general and administrative operating expenses were $ 11,334,634 for the year ended december 31 , 2018 , compared to $ 546,118 for the year ended december 31 , 2017. the increase was primarily attributable to stock-compensation , legal , accounting and other consulting fees which included $ 10,001,359 of stock-based compensation expense incurred in 2018 related to stock options issued to employees and directors and stock payable to a consultant . in addition , the company incurred $ 726,242 of professional fees in 2018 related to legal , accounting and other consulting fees . research and development research and development expenses increased to $ 1,105,389 for the year ended december 31 , 2018 from $ 435,362 for the year ended december 31 , 2017. this increase was due to the start of our phase i mdsc clinical trial program and the acceptance of the phase i/ii clinical trials . other income other income earned in 2017 of $ 149,994 was primarily related to the settlement of a trademark dispute . liquidity and capital resources liquidity is the ability of a company to generate funds to support its current and future operations , satisfy its obligations and otherwise operate on an ongoing basis . we incurred a net loss of $ 12,440,023 and $ 831,486 for the years ended december 31 , 2018 and 2017 , respectively . net cash used in operating activities was $ 2,058,994 and $ 761,834 for the years ended december 31 , 2018 and 2017 , respectively . prior to our february 2019 ipo , we met our liquidity requirements principally through the sale of our common stock in private placements and the sale of our convertible debt to an investor .

"mediation was held on september 7 , 2010. in mediation , the parties executed a memorandum of understanding awarding the plaintiffs $ 4.0 million ( september settlement ) . the story_separator_special_tag management 's discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements , which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states ( gaap ) . gaap represents a comprehensive set of accounting and disclosure rules and requirements , the application of which requires management judgments and estimates including , in certain circumstances , choices between acceptable gaap alternatives . the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities , if any , at the date of the financial statements , and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period . we base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances . actual results could differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions . note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k , contains a comprehensive summary of our significant accounting policies . the following is a discussion of our most critical accounting policies , estimates , judgments and uncertainties that are inherent in our application of gaap . critical accounting estimates revenue recognition matrix service records profits on fixed-price contracts on a percentage-of-completion basis , primarily based on costs incurred to date compared to the total estimated contract cost . matrix service records revenue on reimbursable and time and material contracts on a proportional performance basis as costs are incurred . contracts in process are valued at cost plus accrued profits less billings on uncompleted contracts . contracts are generally considered substantially complete when field construction is completed . the elapsed time from award of a contract to completion of performance may be in excess of one year . matrix service includes pass-through revenue and costs on cost-plus contracts , which are customer-reimbursable materials , equipment and subcontractor costs , when matrix service determines that it is responsible for the procurement and management of such cost components . matrix service has numerous contracts that are in various stages of completion which require estimates to determine the appropriate cost and revenue recognition . matrix service has a history of making reasonably dependable estimates of the extent of progress towards completion , contract revenues and contract costs , and accordingly , does not believe significant fluctuations are likely to materialize . however , current estimates may be revised as additional information becomes available . if estimates of costs to complete fixed-price contracts indicate a loss , a provision is made through a contract write-down for the total loss anticipated . a number of our contracts contain various cost and performance incentives and penalties that impact the earnings we realize from our contracts . adjustments related to these incentives and penalties are recorded in the period on a percentage of completion basis when estimable and probable . indirect costs , such as salaries and benefits , supplies and tools , equipment costs and insurance costs , are charged to projects based upon direct labor hours and overhead allocation rates per direct labor hour . warranty costs are normally incurred prior to project completion and are charged to project costs as they are incurred . warranty costs incurred subsequent to project completion were not material for the periods presented . overhead allocation rates are established annually during the budgeting process and evaluated for accuracy throughout the year based upon actual direct labor hours and actual costs incurred . claims recognition claims are amounts in excess of the agreed contract price that we seek to collect from customers or others for delays , errors in specifications and designs , contract terminations , change orders in dispute or unapproved as to both scope and price or other causes of anticipated additional costs incurred by us . recognition of amounts as additional contract revenue related to claims is appropriate only if it is probable that the claims will result in additional contract revenue and if the amount can be reliably estimated . if all of the following requirements are met , revenue from a claim is recorded only to the extent that we have incurred costs relating to the claim . we must determine if : there is a legal basis for the claim ; the additional costs were caused by circumstances that were unforeseen by the company and are not the result of deficiencies in our performance ; the costs are identifiable or determinable and are reasonable in view of the work performed ; and the evidence supporting the claim is objective and verifiable . - 20 - as of june 30 , 2011 and june 30 , 2010 , costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts included revenues for unapproved change orders of $ 5.1 million and $ 3.0 million , respectively . there were no claims included in costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts as of june 30 , 2011 or june 30 , 2010. historically , our collections for unapproved change orders and other claims have approximated the amount of revenue recognized . loss contingencies various legal actions , claims , and other contingencies arise in the normal course of our business . contingencies are recorded in the consolidated financial statements , or are otherwise disclosed , in accordance with asc 450-20 , loss contingencies . specific reserves are provided for loss contingencies to the extent we conclude that a loss is both probable and estimable . we use a case-by-case evaluation of the underlying data and update our evaluation as further information becomes known . we believe that any amounts exceeding our recorded accruals should not materially affect our financial position , results of operations or liquidity . story_separator_special_tag 17 % , 78 % and 68 % , respectively . recently issued accounting standards there are no recently issued accounting standards that we believe will have a material affect on our financial statements , results of operations or liquidity . results of operations overview the company has two reportable segments , construction services and repair and maintenance services . the majority of the work for both segments is performed in the united states , with 4.8 % of revenues generated in canada during fiscal 2011 as compared to 5.8 % in fiscal 2010. the primary services of our construction services segment are aboveground storage tanks for the bulk storage/terminal industry , capital construction for the downstream petroleum industry , specialty construction , and electrical/instrumentation services for various industries . these services , including civil/structural , mechanical , piping , electrical and instrumentation , millwrighting , and fabrication , are provided for projects of varying complexities , schedule durations , and budgets . our project experience includes renovations , retrofits , modifications and expansions to existing facilities as well as construction of new facilities . the primary services of our repair and maintenance services segment are aboveground storage tank repair and maintenance services , planned major and routine maintenance for the downstream petroleum industry , specialty repair and maintenance services and electrical and instrumentation repair and maintenance . significant fluctuations in revenues , gross profits and operating results are discussed below on a consolidated basis and for each segment . change in fiscal year on july 30 , 2009 , the company 's board of directors approved a change in the company 's fiscal year end from may 31 to june 30 , beginning july 1 , 2009. as a result of the change , the company had a transition period for the one month ended june 30 , 2009 ( june transition period ) . the company 's results of operations for the 12 months ended june

matrix service company story_separator_special_tag size= '' 2 '' style= '' font-family : times new roman '' > gross profit increased from $ 34.4 million in fiscal 2010 to $ 49.5 million in fiscal 2011 due to higher revenues , which increased $ 43.3 million , combined with higher gross margins which increased to 13.6 % in fiscal 2011 compared to 10.8 % in fiscal 2010. fiscal 2010 direct gross margins were negatively affected by a loss of $ 5.4 million on the projects at a gulf coast site . despite this charge , the direct gross margin was essentially unchanged between fiscal 2011 and fiscal 2010 as we were able to achieve higher direct margins on the balance of our work in fiscal 2010. the primary factor in our improved gross margin was the favorable effect of the improved recovery of overhead costs in fiscal 2011 caused by a higher business volume in fiscal 2011 and a non-routine charge on a legal matter of $ 2.3 million in fiscal 2010. repair and maintenance services revenues for the repair and maintenance services segment were $ 262.6 million in fiscal 2011 , compared with $ 229.6 million in fiscal 2010. the increase was primarily due to higher electrical and instrumentation revenues which increased to $ 66.2 million in fiscal 2011 compared to $ 23.5 million in fiscal 2010. the electrical and instrumentation increase was primarily due to higher maintenance work from utilities in the northeastern united states . downstream petroleum revenues were $ 115.3 million in fiscal 2011 compared to $ 115.0 million in fiscal 2010. these increases were partially offset by lower aboveground storage tank revenues which decreased to $ 81.1 million in fiscal 2011 compared to $ 91.1 million in fiscal 2010. gross profit increased from $ 18.5 million in fiscal 2010 to $ 25.4 million in fiscal 2011 due to higher revenues , which increased $ 33.0 million , combined with higher gross margins which increased to 9.7 % in fiscal 2011 compared to 8.1 % in fiscal 2010. the improvement in fiscal 2011 was primarily due to the favorable effect of the improved recovery of overhead costs caused by a higher business volume in fiscal 2011 and a non-routine charge on a legal matter in fiscal 2010 , partially offset by lower direct margins in fiscal 2011. fiscal 2010 versus fiscal 2009 consolidated consolidated revenues were $ 550.8 million in fiscal 2010 , a decrease of $ 138.9 million , or 20.1 % , from consolidated revenues of $ 689.7 million in fiscal 2009. the decline in consolidated revenues was due to an overall decline in our level of business volume as our customers were cautious in their short-term spending leading to short and long-term delays in project awards , downsizing of projects , and delays and reductions in maintenance spending . in addition , we did not experience the full effect of the recession in our core markets until the second half of fiscal 2009. therefore , the comparable prior year revenues were only partially impacted by the effects of the recession . consolidated gross profit decreased from $ 94.3 million in fiscal 2009 to $ 52.9 million in fiscal 2010. the decrease of $ 41.4 million was due to lower business volume and lower gross margins which decreased to 9.6 % in fiscal 2010 compared to 13.7 % a year earlier . the lower gross margins were primarily due to a charge on a legal matter of $ 5.1 million and the loss of $ 5.4 million on the projects at a gulf coast site .

loss ) attributable to quad/graphics common shareholders to ebitda in the `` results of operations '' section below , and see the definitions of free cash flow and debt leverage ratio , the reconciliation of net cash provided by operating activities to free cash flow , and the calculation of debt leverage ratio in the `` liquidity and capital resources '' section below ) . net sales growth . the company uses period over period net sales growth as a key performance metric . the company 's management assesses net sales growth based on the ability to generate increased net sales through increased sales to existing clients , sales to new clients , sales of new or expanded solutions to existing and new clients and opportunities to expand sales through strategic investments , including acquisitions . ebitda and ebitda margin . the company uses ebitda and ebitda margin as metrics to assess operating performance . the company 's management assesses ebitda and ebitda margin based on the ability to increase revenues while controlling variable expense growth . net cash provided by operating activities . the company uses net cash provided by operating activities as a metric to assess liquidity . the company 's management assesses net cash provided by operating activities based on the ability to meet recurring cash obligations while increasing available cash to fund integration and restructuring requirements , including acquired operations and other cost reduction activities , as well as to fund capital expenditures , debt service requirements , world color press single employer pension plan contributions , world color press mepps withdrawal liabilities , acquisitions and other investments in future growth , shareholder dividends and share repurchases . net cash provided by operating activities can be significantly impacted by the timing of non-recurring or infrequent receipts or expenditures . free cash flow . the company uses free cash flow as a metric to assess liquidity and capital deployment . the company 's management assesses free cash flow as a measure to quantify cash available for strengthening the balance sheet ( debt reduction ) , for strategic capital allocation and deployment through investments in the business ( acquisitions and strategic investments ) , and returning capital to the shareholders ( dividends and share repurchases ) . the priorities for capital allocation and deployment will change as circumstances dictate for the business , and free cash flow can be significantly impacted by the company 's restructuring activities and other unusual items . debt leverage ratio . the company uses the debt leverage ratio as a metric to assess liquidity and the flexibility of its balance sheet . consistent with other liquidity metrics , the company monitors the debt leverage ratio as a measure to determine the appropriate level of debt the company believes is optimal to operate its business , and accordingly , to quantify debt capacity available for strategic capital allocation and deployment through investments in the business ( capital expenditures and acquisitions ) , for strengthening the balance sheet ( debt and pension liability reduction ) , and for returning capital to the shareholders ( dividends and share repurchases ) . the priorities for capital allocation and deployment will change as circumstances dictate for the business , and the debt leverage ratio can be significantly impacted by the amount and timing of large expenditures requiring debt financing , as well as changes in profitability . 42 overview of trends affecting quad/graphics competition in the highly fragmented printing industry remains intense , and the company believes that there are indicators of heightened competitive pressures . the industry has excess manufacturing capacity created by continued declines in industry volumes which , in turn , has created accelerated downward pricing pressures . in addition , digital delivery of documents and data , including the online distribution and hosting of media content and mobile technologies , offer alternatives to traditional delivery of printed documents . increasing consumer acceptance of digital delivery of content has resulted in marketers and publishers allocating their marketing and advertising spend across the expanding selection of digital delivery options , which further reduces printing demand and contributes to industry overcapacity . the company also faces competition from print management firms , which look to streamline processes and reduce the overall print spend of the company 's clients , as well as from strategic marketing firms focused on helping businesses integrate multiple channels into their marketing campaigns . the company believes that a disciplined approach for capital management and a strong balance sheet are critical to be able to invest in profitable growth opportunities and technological advances , thereby providing the highest return for shareholders . management balances the use of cash between compelling investment opportunities , deleveraging the company 's balance sheet ( through reduction in debt and pension obligations ) , and returns to shareholders ( through share repurchases and a quarterly dividend of $ 0.30 per share ) . the company continues to remain disciplined with its debt leverage . the company 's consolidated debt and capital leases decreased by $ 56 million during the year ended december 31 , 2015 , despite investing $ 133 million in capital expenditures and $ 143 million in acquisitions ( primarily the 2015 marin 's , copac and specialty acquisitions ) . since the company completed the world color press acquisition in july 2010 , the company has reduced debt and capital leases by $ 390 million and has reduced the obligations for pension , postretirement and mepps by $ 361 million .

"the following table summarizes additional information story_separator_special_tag the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition , results of operations , and liquidity and capital resources for the 52 weeks ended january 28 , 2018 ( fiscal 2017 ) , the 52 weeks ended january 29 , 2017 ( fiscal 2016 ) , and the 52 weeks ended january 31 , 2016 ( fiscal 2015 ) should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto . all explanations of changes in operational results are discussed in order of magnitude . overview net revenues in fiscal 2017 increased by $ 208,547,000 or 4.1 % , compared to fiscal 2016 , with comparable brand revenue growth of 3.2 % . this increase in net revenues was driven by a 5.5 % increase in e-commerce net revenues ( primarily driven by west elm , williams sonoma and rejuvenation ) and a 2.6 % increase in retail net revenues ( primarily driven by pottery barn and west elm ) , with particular strength in furniture . total fiscal 2017 net revenue growth included a 1.4 % increase in store leased square footage primarily due to 2 net new stores , and a 2.2 % increase in international revenues primarily related to our company-owned international operations . in fiscal 2017 , we made progress on our four strategic priorities of digital leadership , product innovation , retail transformation and operational excellence . to expand our digital leadership , we accelerated our investments in technology and advertising to drive new customer acquisition , conversion and an improved shopping experience . in product innovation , we evolved our product strategies to better align to shifting consumer preferences and broaden our brands ' market reach . in retail , we focused our efforts around value-added services , inspiration and convenience , as our stores remain an important source for new customer acquisition , establishing brand loyalty and driving sales across our multi-channel platform . and , in our goal of operational excellence , we focused on cost efficiencies in the supply chain and inventory optimization to offset our investments in the business , including improving the speed of order fulfillment and delivery and reducing the rate of returns and damages . all of these strategic initiatives helped drive the net revenue growth in our brands , particularly in pottery barn , which ended the year with 1.0 % comparable brand revenue growth compared to a decline of 3.5 % in fiscal 2016. additionally , in fiscal 2017 , diluted earnings per share was $ 3.02 ( which included $ 0.48 of tax expense related to the recently enacted tax cuts and jobs act - see note d to our consolidated financial statements , as well as $ 0.11 due to severance-related charges and our acquisition of outward , inc. ) versus $ 3.41 in fiscal 2016. we also returned $ 331,189,000 to our stockholders through stock repurchases and dividends . as we look forward to fiscal 2018 , we plan to drive growth across our brands by focusing on our four strategic priorities , as well as through new product categories and markets where we see significant potential . in digital advertising , we will continue to focus on vehicles that drive awareness and improve perception , while optimizing our catalog strategy and in-house capabilities to maximize our total advertising spend . we plan to leverage important technology trends such as 3d visualization , augmented reality , artificial intelligence and machine learning to further enhance the customer experience . in retail , we plan to invest in optimizing top-performing stores while closing underperforming stores , including the early closure of a number of domestic stores . in addition to executing on our growth initiatives , we will also be focused on driving operational excellence throughout our business . we see substantial cost savings opportunities , particularly in supply chain , inventory management , increased order visibility , and improved speed and quality of delivery , all of which will further enhance the customer experience and drive down returns and replacements , as well as drive down costs over time . in summary , fiscal 2017 was a year in which we made meaningful progress in strengthening our business for long-term , profitable growth . as we enter fiscal 2018 , we are confident that our competitive advantages , along with our drive for continuous operational excellence , will allow us to continue the momentum we are seeing in the business and to deliver long-term sustainable returns for our stockholders . 27 story_separator_special_tag shipping , damage and replacement costs than the retail channel . fiscal 2017 vs. fiscal 2016 cost of goods sold

's code of ethics and other corporate governance documents are also available on the company 's website in the investor relations section of the website . item 1a . risk factors changes in interest rates could adversely impact the company 's financial condition and results of operations . the company 's ability to make a profit , like that of most financial institutions , substantially depends upon its net interest income , which is the difference between the interest income earned on interest earning assets , such as loans and investment securities , and the interest expense paid on interest-bearing liabilities , such as deposits and borrowings . however , certain assets and liabilities may react differently to changes in market interest rates . further , interest rates on some types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate prior to changes in broader market interest rates , while rates on other types of assets may lag behind . additionally , some assets such as adjustable-rate mortgages have features , such as rate caps and floors , which restrict changes in their interest rates . factors such as inflation , recession , unemployment , money supply , global disorder , instability in domestic and foreign financial markets , and other factors beyond the company 's control , may affect interest rates . changes in market interest rates will also affect the level of voluntary prepayments on loans and the receipt of payments on mortgage-backed securities , resulting in the receipt of proceeds that may have to be reinvested at a lower rate than the loan or mortgage-backed security being prepaid . the state of the financial and credit markets , and potential sovereign debt defaults may severely impact the global and domestic economies and may lead to a significantly tighter environment in terms of liquidity and availability of credit . economic growth may slow down and the national economy may experience additional recession periods . market disruption , government and central bank policy actions intended to counteract the effects of recession , changes in investor expectations regarding compensation for market risk , credit risk and liquidity risk and changing economic data could continue to have dramatic effects on both the volatility of and the magnitude of the directional movements of interest rates . although the company pursues an asset/liability management strategy designed to control its risk from changes in interest rates , changes in market interest rates can have a material adverse effect on the company 's profitability . a further deterioration of the credit rating for u.s. long-term sovereign debt could adversely impact the company . on august 5 , 2011 , standard and poor 's downgraded the u.s. long-term sovereign debt from aaa , the highest rating , to aa+ , the second highest rating . this downgrade did not directly impact the financial position or outlook for the company , but a further downgrade as a result of an inability by the federal government to raise the u.s. debt limit or otherwise could result in a re-evaluation of the ‘ risk-free ' rate used in many accounting models , other-than-temporary-impairment of securities and or impairment of goodwill and other intangibles . if the company has higher than anticipated loan losses than it has modeled , its earnings could materially decrease . the company 's loan customers may not repay loans according to their terms , and the collateral securing the payment of loans may be insufficient to assure repayment . the company may therefore experience significant credit losses which could have a material adverse effect on its operating results and capital ratios . the company makes various assumptions and judgments about the collectability of its loan portfolio , including the creditworthiness of borrowers and the value of the real estate and other assets serving as collateral for the repayment of loans . in determining the amount of the allowance for loan losses , the company relies on its experience and its evaluation of economic conditions . if its assumptions prove to be incorrect , its current allowance for loan losses may not be sufficient to cover losses inherent in its loan portfolio and an adjustment may be necessary to allow for different economic conditions or adverse developments in its loan portfolio . consequently , a problem with one or more loans could require the company to significantly increase the level of its provision for loan losses . story_separator_special_tag there can be no assurance that acquisitions will not have an adverse effect upon the company 's operating results while the operations of the acquired business are being integrated into the company 's operations . in addition , once integrated , acquired operations may not achieve levels of profitability comparable to those achieved by the company 's existing operations , or otherwise perform as expected . further , transaction-related expenses may adversely affect the company 's earnings . these adverse effects on the company 's earnings and results of operations may have a negative impact on the value of the company 's stock . difficult market conditions have adversely affected the industry in which the company operates . in recent years , dramatic declines in the housing market , with falling real estate values and increasing foreclosures , unemployment , and under-employment negatively impacted the credit performance of mortgage loans and resulted in significant write-downs of asset values by financial institutions , including government-sponsored entities as well as major commercial and investment banks . these write-downs , initially of mortgage-backed securities but spreading to credit default swaps and other derivative and cash securities , in turn , caused many financial institutions to seek additional capital , to merge with larger and stronger institutions and , in some cases to fail . reflecting concern about the stability of the financial markets generally and the strength of counterparties , many lenders 20 and institutional investors reduced or ceased providing funding to borrowers , including to other financial institutions . this market turmoil and tightening of credit led to an increased level of commercial and consumer delinquencies , lack of consumer confidence , increased market volatility and widespread reduction of business activity generally . a resumption of economic pressure on consumers and lack of confidence in the financial markets could materially affect the company 's business , financial condition and results of operations . a worsening of these conditions would likely have adverse effects on the company and others in the financial services industry . in particular , the company may face the following risks in connection with these events : the company could face increased regulation of its industry . compliance with such regulation may increase its costs and limit its ability to pursue business opportunities . market developments may affect customer confidence levels and may cause increases in loan delinquencies and default rates , which the company expects could impact its loan charge-offs and provision for loan losses . deterioration or defaults made by issuers of the underlying collateral of the company 's investment securities may cause credit related other-than-temporary impairment charges to the company 's income statement . the company 's ability to borrow from other financial institutions or to access the debt or equity capital markets on favorable terms or at all could be adversely affected by further disruptions in the capital markets or other events , including actions by rating agencies and deteriorating investor expectations . competition in the industry could intensify as a result of the increasing consolidation of financial services companies in connection with adverse market conditions . the company could be required to pay significantly higher fdic premiums if market developments significantly deplete the insurance fund of the fdic and reduce the ratio of reserves to insured deposits . it may become necessary or advisable for the company , due to changes in regulatory requirements , change in market conditions , or for other reasons , to hold more capital or to alter the forms of capital it currently maintains . the company 's securities portfolio performance in difficult market conditions could have adverse effects on the company 's results of operations . under generally accepted accounting principles , the company is required to review the company 's investment portfolio periodically for the presence of other-than-temporary impairment of its securities , taking into consideration current market conditions , the extent and nature of changes in fair value , issuer rating changes and trends , volatility of earnings , current analysts ' evaluations , the company 's ability and intent to hold investments until a recovery of fair value , as well as other factors . adverse developments with respect to one or more of the foregoing factors may require the company to deem particular securities to be other-than-temporarily impaired , with the credit related portion of the reduction in the value recognized as a charge to the company 's earnings . recent market volatility has made it extremely difficult to value certain of the company 's securities . subsequent valuations , in light of factors prevailing at that time , may result in significant changes in the values of these securities in future periods . any of these factors could require the company to recognize further impairments in the value of the company 's securities portfolio , which may have an adverse effect on the company 's results of operations in future periods . i mpairment of goodwill and or intangible assets could require charges to earnings , which could result in a negative impact on our results of operations . goodwill arises when a business is purchased for an amount greater than the net fair value of its assets . the bank has recognized goodwill as an asset on the balance sheet in connection with several acquisitions ( see note 6 “ goodwill and identifiable intangible assets ” within notes to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 hereof ) . when an intangible asset is determined to have an indefinite useful life , it is not amortized , and instead is evaluated for impairment . goodwill is subject to impairment tests annually , or more frequently if necessary , and is evaluated using a two step impairment approach . a significant and sustained decline in the company 's stock price and market capitalization , a significant decline in the company 's expected future cash flows , a significant adverse change in the business climate , slower growth rates or other factors could result in impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets .
","2012 results the company reported net income of $ 42.6 million in 2012 as compared to $ 45.4 million in 2011 . 2012 was negatively impacted by merger and acquisition expenses , goodwill impairment and a higher provision for loan losses associated with strong growth in the loan portfolio as well as increased loan losses , primarily due to a commercial loan fraud . management considers certain of these items to be non-core in nature and presents the following discussion of operating earnings as a non-gaap measure , intended to provide the reader with a sense of the performance of its core banking business . net income on an operating basis improved to $ 47.1 million in 2012 , as compared to $ 45.5 million in 2011 , an increase of 3.6 % . these results were due to a combination of : strong organic loan growth ( +8.3 % ) and organic deposit growth ( +8.1 % ) declining net interest margin , reflecting the challenging interest rate environment solid growth in noninterest income ( +16.4 % ) good expense control increased provision for loan losses the following table illustrates key performance measures for the periods indicated : replace_table_token_6_th recognizing the importance of noninterest income , management continued to focus on growing this category . 2012 represented strong growth in noninterest income in the absolute ( +16.4 % ) and as a percentage of total revenue ( increased to 26.0 % ) . 28 the increases in noninterest income for the year ended 2012 were driven by the following items : interchange and atm fees increased to by 26.5 % to $ 9.8 million in 2012 , from $ 7.7 million in 2011. the increase was partially due to increased debit card usage by the bank 's customers following increased promotion and sales activities . mortgage banking income is up $ 2.3 million , reflective of strong mortgage originations and refinancing activity due to the low rate environment .

the fair market value of the awards on the grant date and the company records compensation expense based on this value , net of a forfeiture rate . the forfeiture rate estimates the number of awards that will eventually vest and is based on historical vesting patterns for rsus . a summary of the status of the company 's unvested rsus as of december 31 , 2019 and changes during the year then ended are presented below ( number of units in millions , except fair value per unit ) : replace_table_token_22_th the total number of shares vested in the table above includes 0.2 million shares

to the dcf model include ( i ) future revenues , ( ii ) earnings before interest , taxes depreciation and amortization ( `` ebitda '' ) and ( iii ) the weighted average cost of capital discount rate . estimates of future financial results are subject to change and may be affected by both micro and macroeconomic conditions . the quantitative assessment indicated there was excess fair value over the reporting unit 's carrying amount as of october 31 , 2019. we conducted a sensitivity analysis on the discount rate . holding all other assumptions constant , an increase of 200 basis points would not cause the fair value of the reporting unit to be below its carrying amount . 17 story_separator_special_tag > 19.6 percent of revenues ) in 2019 , compared with $ 705.0 million ( 20.7 percent of revenues ) in 2018 . the increase in sg & a expenses is primarily due to ( i ) an increase in compensation expenses commensurate with growth in the business and ( ii ) inclusion of ecs for the full year in 2019 , compared with only nine months in 2018 from the date of its acquisition on april 2 , 2018. total sg & a expenses as a percentage of revenues decreased in 2019 due to ( i ) the inclusion of ecs for a full year as it has a lower sg & a expenses to revenues ratio than our other segments and ( ii ) lower acquisition , integration and strategic planning expenses , which totaled $ 6.6 million in 2019 , compared with $ 16.6 million in 2018 . amortization of intangible assets amortization of intangible assets was $ 51.1 million , compared with $ 58.5 million in 2018 . the decrease was due to the accelerated amortization method of certain acquired intangibles , which have high amortization rates at the beginning of their useful lives . interest expense interest expense was $ 52.9 million , down from $ 56.0 million in 2018. interest expense on indebtedness was $ 47.4 million in 2019 , up approximately $ 2.9 million from 2018 , mainly related to an increase in the average interest rate . the difference in average borrowings outstanding during the periods and in the amortization of deferred loan costs was not significant . interest expense in 2018 did however include $ 6.2 million in debt costs related to the amendment of the senior credit facility during that year . write-off of loan costs as a result of the amendment to our senior credit facility and the pay down of borrowings under that facility with the proceeds from the issuance of senior notes , we wrote-off deferred loan costs totaling $ 18.9 million related to the senior credit facility . provision for income taxes the provision for income taxes was $ 62.0 million , up from $ 46.2 million in 2018 . the effective tax rate for 2019 was 26.2 percent , up from 22.6 percent for 2018 . the lower effective tax rate in 2018 was mainly the result of ( i ) adjustments to the provisional estimates under the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 ( `` tcja '' ) based on irs guidelines issued in 2018 and ( ii ) higher excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation . net income net income was $ 174.7 million in 2019 , compared with $ 157.7 million in 2018 . ecs segment contract backlog contract backlog is a useful measure of potential future revenues for our ecs segment . contract backlog represents the estimated amount of future revenues to be recognized under awarded contracts including task orders and options . contract backlog does not include potential value from contract awards that have been protested by competitors until the protest is resolved in our favor . contract backlog does not include any estimate of future work expected under indefinite delivery , indefinite quantity ( `` idiq '' ) contracts or u.s. general services administration ( `` gsa '' ) schedules . ecs segregates contract backlog into funded contract backlog and negotiated unfunded contract backlog , which together make up total contract backlog . funded contract backlog for contracts with u.s. government agencies primarily represents contracts for which funding has been formally awarded less revenues previously recognized on these contracts and does not include the unfunded portion of contracts where funding is incrementally awarded or authorized by the u.s. government even though the contract may call for performance over a number of years . funded contract backlog for contracts with non-government agencies represents the estimated value of contracts , which may cover multiple future years , less revenue previously recognized on these contracts . negotiated unfunded contract backlog represents the estimated future revenues to be earned from negotiated contract awards for which funding has not yet been awarded or authorized and from unexercised priced contract options . contract backlog estimates are subject to change and may be affected by the execution of new contracts , the extension or early termination of existing contracts , the non-renewal or completion of current contracts and adjustments to estimates for previously included contracts . changes in the funded contract backlog are also affected by the funding cycles of the government . the contract backlog as of december
